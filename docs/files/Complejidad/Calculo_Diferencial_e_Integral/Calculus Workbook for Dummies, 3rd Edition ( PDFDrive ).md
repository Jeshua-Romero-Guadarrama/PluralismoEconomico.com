Introduction

I

f you’ve already bought this book or are thinking about buying it, it’s probably too late — too

late, that is, to change your mind and get the heck out of calculus. (If you’ve still got a chance

to break free, get out and run for the hills!) Okay, so you’re stuck with calculus; you’re past

the point of no return. Is there any hope? Of course! For starters, buy this gem of a book and my

other classic, Calculus For Dummies (also published by Wiley). In both books, you ﬁnd calculus

explained in plain English with a minimum of technical jargon. Calculus For Dummies covers

topics in greater depth. Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition, gives you the opportunity to

master the calculus topics you study in class or in Calculus For Dummies through a couple hundred

practice problems that will leave you giddy with the joy of learning . . . or pulling your hair out.

In all seriousness, calculus is not nearly as diﬃcult as you’d guess from its reputation. It’s a

logical extension of algebra and geometry, and many calculus topics can be easily understood

when you see the algebra and geometry that underlie them.

It should go without saying that regardless of how well you think you understand calculus, you

won’t fully understand it until you get your hands dirty by actually doing problems. On that

score, you’ve come to the right place.

About This Book

Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition, like Calculus For Dummies, is intended for three

groups of readers: high school seniors or college students in their ﬁrst calculus course, students

who’ve taken calculus but who need a refresher to get ready for other pursuits, and adults of

all ages who want to practice the concepts they learned in Calculus For Dummies or elsewhere.

Whenever possible, I bring calculus down to earth by showing its connections to basic algebra

and geometry. Many calculus problems look harder than they actually are because they contain

so many fancy, foreign-looking symbols. When you see that the problems aren’t that diﬀerent

from related algebra and geometry problems, they become far less intimidating.

I supplement the problem explanations with tips, shortcuts, and mnemonic devices. Often, a

simple tip or memory trick can make it much easier to learn and retain a new, diﬃcult concept.

This book uses certain conventions:

»

»

»

Variables are in italics.

Important math terms are often in italics and deﬁned when necessary.

Extra-hard problems are marked with an asterisk. You may want to skip these if you’re

prone to cerebral hemorrhaging.

Introduction

1





Like all For Dummies books, you can use this book as a reference. You don’t need to read it cover

to cover or work through all problems in order. You may need more practice in some areas than

others, so you may choose to do only half of the practice problems in some sections or none at all.

However, as you’d expect, the order of the topics in Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edi-

tion, follows the order of the traditional curriculum of a ﬁrst-year calculus course. You can,

therefore, go through the book in order, using it to supplement your coursework. If I do say so

myself, I expect you’ll ﬁnd that many of the explanations, methods, strategies, and tips in this

book will make problems you found diﬃcult or confusing in class seem much easier.

Foolish Assumptions

Now that you know a bit about how I see calculus, here’s what I’m assuming about you:

»

You haven’t forgotten all the algebra, geometry, and trigonometry you learned in high school.

If you have, calculus will be really tough. Just about every single calculus problem involves

algebra, a great many use trig, and quite a few use geometry. If you’re really rusty, go back to

these basics and do some brushing up. This book contains some practice problems to give

you a little pre-calc refresher, and Calculus For Dummies has an excellent pre-calc review.

»

You’re willing to invest some time and eﬀort in doing these practice problems. As with any-

thing, practice makes perfect, and, also like anything, practice sometimes involves struggle.

But that’s a good thing. Ideally, you should give these problems your best shot before you

turn to the solutions. Reading through the solutions can be a good way to learn, but you’ll

usually learn more if you push yourself to solve the problems on your own — even if that

means going down a few dead ends.

Icons Used in This Book

The icons help you to quickly ﬁnd some of the most critical ideas in the book.

Next to this icon are important pre-calc or calculus deﬁnitions, theorems, and so on.

This icon is next to — are you sitting down? — example problems.

The tip icon gives you shortcuts, memory devices, strategies, and so on.

Ignore these icons and you’ll be doing lots of extra work and probably getting the wrong answer.

Getting Down to Basics:

Algebra and Geometr y

I

know, I know. This is a calculus workbook, so what’s with the algebra and geometry? Don’t

worry; I’m not going to waste too many precious pages with algebra and geometry, but these

topics are essential for calculus. You can no more do calculus without algebra than you can

write French poetry without French. And basic geometry (but not geometry proofs) is critically

important because much of calculus involves real-world problems that include angles, slopes,

shapes, and so on. So in this chapter — and in Chapter 2 on functions and trigonometry —

I give you some quick problems to help you brush up on your skills. If you’ve already got these

topics down pat, you can skip to Chapter 3.

In addition to working through the problems in Chapters 1 and 2 in this book, you may want to

check out the great pre-calc review in Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition.

Fraction Frustration

Many, many math students hate fractions. I’m not sure why, because there’s nothing especially

diﬃcult about them. Perhaps for some students, fraction concepts didn’t completely click when

they ﬁrst studied them, and then fractions became a nagging frustration whenever they came

up in subsequent math courses. Whatever the cause, if you don’t like fractions, try to get over it.

Fractions really are a piece o’ cake; you’ll have to deal with them in every math course you take.

You can’t do calculus without a good grasp of fractions. For example, the very deﬁnition of the

derivative is based on a fraction called the diﬀerence quotient. And, on top of that, the symbol for

the derivative,

dy, is a fraction. So, if you’re a bit rusty with fractions, get up to speed with the

Geometry: When Am I Ever Going to Need It?

You can use calculus to solve many real-world problems that involve two- or three-dimensional

shapes and various curves, surfaces, and volumes — such as calculating the rate at which the

water level is falling in a cone-shaped tank or determining the dimensions that maximize the

volume of a cylindrical soup can. So the geometry formulas for perimeter, area, volume, surface

area, and so on will come in handy. You should also know things like the Pythagorean Theorem,

proportional shapes, and basic coordinate geometry, like the midpoint and distance formulas.

(that’s why it’s undeﬁned). Or just remember that it’s impossible to drive up a vertical road,

so it’s impossible to come up with a slope for a vertical line. The fraction

0, on the other

8

hand, has a rise of 0 and a run of 8, which gives you a horizontal line that has no steepness at

all and thus has the perfectly ordinary slope of zero. Of course, it’s also perfectly ordinary to

When you’re working a problem and can’t remember the algebra rule, try the problem with

work out the numerical problem. (Don’t use 0, 1, or 2 because they have special properties

that can mess up your test.) Whatever works for the numbers will work with variables, and

whatever doesn’t work with numbers won’t work with variables. Watch what happens if you

\5. You may also want to express the answer symbolically.

Because x can equal a number in the left region or a number in the right region, this is an

regions on the number line, you want the union of the two regions. So, the symbolic

answer is

(You can write the above using the word “or” instead of the union symbol.) If only the

(You can use the word “and” instead of the intersection symbol.) Note that in this solu-

course, because zero squared equals zero. And you know that the absolute value of –1 is 1;

you just have to be careful not to goof up with all those negative signs and subtraction signs.

29 What’s the length of altitude of triangle ABC? 2 3.

There are a few ways to solve this problem, all of which use your knowledge of 30°-60°-90°

triangles. Here’s a quick and easy way. Triangle ABC is a 30°-60°-90° triangle, and the short

leg of a 30°-60°-90° triangle is half as long as its hypotenuse, so BC is 4. Triangle BCD is

another 30°-60°-90° triangle, so its short leg is half as long as its hypotenuse. That gives DC

a length of 2. Then, because BD is the long leg of 30°-60°-90° triangle BCD, it’s 3 times its

short leg. That gives you the answer of 2 3, for altitude BD.

CHAPTER 1 Getting Down to Basics: Algebra and Geometry

21





30 What’s the perimeter of triangle ABD? 6 6 3.

Triangle ABD is yet another 30°-60°-90° triangle, so its hypotenuse is twice as long as its

short leg, BD. That gives you a length of 4 3 for AB. Next, AD is 8 – 2, or 6. The perimeter

of triangle ABD is therefore 6 2 3 4 3, or 6 6 3.

31 What’s the area of quadrilateral PQRS? 27 9 3.

Piece o’ cake. Begin with triangle QRS, which you can see is a 45°-45°-90° triangle. The legs

of a 45°-45°-90° triangle are equal, so QR is 6, and the hypotenuse of a 45°-45°-90° triangle

is 2 times either leg, so QS is 6 2.

Now you see that the hypotenuse of triangle TQS is twice as long as its short leg, QT , which

tells you that triangle TQS is a 30°-60°-90° triangle. That makes TQS 60°, and you also

get the length of TS, which, since it’s the long leg of 30°-60°-90° triangle TQS, has to be

3 times as long as its short leg, QT . So TS is 3 6.

Next, since PQR is 150°, and angles TQS and SQR are 60° and 45°, respectively, you subtract

to get 45° for PQT . That makes triangle PQT a 45°-45°-90° triangle, and thus PT , like QT ,

is 3 2.

Now you have everything you need to ﬁgure the area of the quadrilateral. The area of a right

triangle equals half the product of its legs, so here’s the ﬁnal math:

32 What’s the perimeter of triangle BCD?10

.

To do this problem and the next one, you ﬁrst have to establish that the two triangles are

similar (the same shape). Because segments BD and AE are parallel, angles BDC and AED are

corresponding angles and are therefore congruent. And the two triangles share angle C. Thus,

by the AA (angle-angle) theorem, triangles BCD and ACE are similar.

To get the length of BC, you could use similar triangle proportions, but it’s a little bit quicker

BC

to use the side-splitter theorem, which tells you that

can set BC equal to 4x and AB equal to 8x. They add up to 13, so you have 4x 8x 13, or

. Plugging that into 4x gives you

for the length of BC.

Now all you need to ﬁnish is the length of BD. Did you fall for the nasty trap in this problem?

When you see the 4 and the 8 along the right side of triangle ACE, it’s easy to make the mis-

take of thinking that BD and AE will be in the same 4-to-8 or 1-to-2 ratio and conclude that

BD therefore equals 3. But BD and AE are not in a 1-to-2 ratio. To get BD, you have to use a

similar triangle proportion like the following:

Problem 32? or1: 9.

If you know the appropriate theorem for this problem, the problem’s a snap. If you don’t

know the theorem, the problem’s very hard. You could also get tripped up if you thought you

needed the areas of the two triangles (you don’t), and you could be thrown oﬀ by the trap

referred to in Problem 32.

All you need is the theorem that tells you that the ratio of the areas of similar ﬁgures is equal

to the square of the ratio of any of their corresponding sides. For this problem, the theorem

tells you that

(Note that you did not need to know the altitudes of the triangles or their areas in order to

compute the ratio of their areas.)

In plain English, the idea is simply that if you take any 2-D shape and blow it up to, say,

4 times its height, its area will grow 42, or 16 times. By the way, if you blow up a 3-D shape,

say, 4 times its height, its volume will grow 43, or 64 times.

When you see a 60° angle in a problem, one of the ﬁrst things you should consider is the

30°-60°-90° triangle. Sure enough, that’s the key to this problem.

All you need to do is to drop an altitude from Q straight down to base PS , making a right

angle with PS . Call the point where the altitude meets the base point T. Triangle PQT

contains a 60° angle and a 90° angle, so it has to be a 30°-60°-90° triangle. The short leg of a

1

30°-60°-90° triangle is half as long as its hypotenuse, so PT is half of PQ, or y. Then,

because the long leg of a 30°-60°-90° triangle is 3 times as long as its short leg, altitude

I

n Chapter 2, you continue your pre-calc warm-up that you began in Chapter 1. If algebra

is the language calculus is written in, you might think of functions as the “sentences” of

calculus. And they’re as important to calculus as sentences are to writing. You can’t do

calculus without functions. Trig is important not because it’s an essential element of calculus —

you could do a great deal of calculus without trig — but because many calculus problems

happen to involve trigonometry.

Figuring Out Your Functions

To make a long story short, a function is basically anything you can graph on your graph-

ing calculator in “y =” or graphing mode. The line y 3x 2 is a function, as is the parab-

ola y 4x

2

3x 6. On the other hand, the sideways parabola x 5y

2

4y 10 isn’t a function

something, which

because there’s no way to write it as y something (unless you write y

doesn’t count).

You can determine whether or not the graph of a curve is a function with the vertical line test. If

there’s no place on the graph where you could draw a vertical line that touches the curve more

than once, then it is a function. And if you can draw a vertical line anywhere on the graph that

touches the curve more than once, then it is not a function.

CHAPTER 2 Funky Functions and Tricky Trig

As you know, you can rewrite the above functions using f x or g x instead of y. This changes

nothing; using something like f x is just a convenient notation. Here’s a sampling of calculus

Trigonometric Calisthenics

Believe it or not, trigonometry is a very practical, real-world branch of mathematics, because

it involves the measurement of lengths and angles. Surveyors use it when surveying property,

making topographical maps, and so on. The ancient Greeks and Alexandrians, among others,

knew not only simple SohCahToa stuﬀ, but a lot of sophisticated trig as well. They used it for

building, navigation, and astronomy. Trigonometry comes up a lot in the study of calculus, so

if you snoozed through high school trig, WAKE UP! and review the following problems. (If you

want to delve further into trig and functions, check out Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition, also

written by me and published by Wiley.)

Solutions to Functions and Trigonometry

Which of the four relations in the ﬁgure represent functions and why? A and D.

The circle and the S-shaped curve are not functions because they fail the vertical line test:

You can draw a vertical line somewhere on their graphs that touches the curve more than

once. These two curves also fail the algebraic test: A curve is a function if for each input

value (x) there is at most one output value (y). The circle and the S-shaped curve have some x’s

that correspond to more than one y, so they are not functions. Note that the reverse is not

true: You can have a function where there are two or more input values (x’s) for a single

output value (y).

transformations, on the other hand, go the normal way — up for plus and down for minus.

That’s all there is to it. Don’t forget, there’s nothing wrong with the square root of zero,

which equals zero. So 4 is in the domain of g.

b. What’s the range of g? g x

\0.

Range questions are usually a bit harder than domain questions. With domain questions,

you just have to ﬁgure out what x cannot be, and the domain is everything else. With

range questions, there’s no method quite that straightforward.

To tackle a range question, you can experiment with diﬀerent input values and see what

happens with the output. And, of course, you can graph the function to actually see the

range, though that won’t always give you the precise answer. Sometimes, like in Problem 8,

you can’t get the precise answer without doing some calculus.

You can solve the current problem easily by just looking at the graph of the function. But

it’ll also come in handy to familiarize yourself with the following approach.

y

looks

You can answer the current range question if you know what the graph of

like. If you don’t remember the graph, you should graph it now on your calculator. You’ll

see the top half of a sideways parabola that begins at 0, 0 and goes up and to the right

forever. Because it begins at a height of zero and goes up forever, the range is y 0.

The current function, g x

4

x, is a transformation of the parent function, y

x.

There are two transformations: the 4 and the minus sign, which is the same as multiply-

ing x by –1. Because both transformations occur “inside” the function and change the

input of the function, they are both horizontal transformations. (To transform the parent

function, y

x, into g x

4

x, you’d ﬁrst slide it 4 to the left and then ﬂip it over

the y axis.) Horizontal transformations change the domain but have no impact on the

range, so the range of g x

Just ask yourself what x is not allowed to be. x can’t equal zero because that would make the

denominator zero. And x can’t equal –5 because that would give you the square root of zero,

which is zero, so, again, the denominator would equal zero. That takes care of the zero

denominator issue. Then there’s the issue of no negatives under the square root. So x can’t be

less than –5. That does it. The domain is everything else — everything except what we just

excluded.

21 What’s tan 3 cot 3 ? Undeﬁned.

This problem is a bit tricky because there’s a catch (actually two catches). But other than

that, it’s actually short and simple. An angle of 3 radians is the same as radians, so you

just use the coordinates from the unit circle at radians or 180 degrees — namely, 1, 0 .

cot 3

, which is undeﬁned. (Don’t forget, you can’t divide by zero!) Thus, your answer

0

for tan 3 cot 3 is zero times undeﬁned, which is undeﬁned.

Here are the two catches: First, you might think that zero times undeﬁned is zero because

zero times anything is zero. But it doesn’t work that way. If any piece of a problem is unde-

ﬁned, the answer is undeﬁned. The second catch is that you could mistakenly conclude that

since tangent and cotangent are reciprocals, their product would be 1. That is generally true

of reciprocals, but not here because, again, one of them is undeﬁned. The two values you get

here, zero and undeﬁned, are sort of, but not technically, reciprocals. So you can’t multiply

them to get 1. No matter how you look at it, the answer is undeﬁned.

For the tangent piece of the problem, here’s a tip. Tangent equals

problems on the unit circle, you don’t have to bother dividing the y fraction by the x fraction.

The denominators of these fractions always cancel, so you only have to put the y numerator

Thousand Words: Limits

and Continuity

Y

ou can use ordinary algebra and geometry when the things in a math problem aren’t

changing (sort of) and when lines are straight. But you need calculus when things are

changing (these changing things are often represented as curves). For example, you need

calculus to analyze something like the motion of the space shuttle during the beginning of its

ﬂight because its acceleration is changing every split second.

Ordinary algebra and geometry fall short for such things because the algebra or geometry

formula that works one moment no longer works a millionth of a second later. Calculus, on

the other hand, chops up these constantly changing things — like the motion of the space

shuttle — into such tiny bits (actually inﬁnitely small bits) that within each bit, things don’t

change. Then you can use ordinary algebra and geometry.

Limits are the “magical” trick or tool that does this chopping up of something into inﬁnitely

small bits. It’s the mathematics of limits that makes calculus work. Limits are so essential to

calculus that the two bedrock ideas of calculus — the formal deﬁnitions of the derivative and

the deﬁnite integral — both involve limits.

If — when your parents asked you, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” — you

responded, “Why, a mathematician, of course,” then you may want to spend a great deal of

time studying the deep and rich subtleties of continuity. For the rest of you, the concept of

continuity is a total no-brainer. If you can draw a graph without lifting your pen or pencil

from the page, the graph is continuous. If you can’t — because there’s a break in the graph —

then the graph is not continuous. That’s all there is to it. By the way, there are some subtle and

technical connections between limits and continuity (which I don’t want to get into), and that’s

why they’re in the same chapter. But, be honest now, did you buy this book because you were

dying to learn about mathematical subtleties and technicalities?

Digesting the Deﬁnitions: Limit and Continuity

This short section covers a couple formal deﬁnitions and a couple other things you need to

know about limits and continuity. Here’s the formal, three-part deﬁnition of a limit:

For a function f x and a real number a, limf x exists if and only if

x

a

\1. lim f x exists. In other words, there must be a limit from the left.

x

a

\2. lim f x exists. There must be a limit from the right.

x

a

\3. lim f x

lim f x The limit from the left must equal the limit from the right.

x

a

x

a

(Note that this deﬁnition does not apply to limits as x approaches inﬁnity or negative inﬁnity.)

And here’s the deﬁnition of continuity: A function f x is continuous at a point a if three con-

ditions are satisﬁed:

\1. f a is deﬁned.

\2. limf x exists.

x

a

\3. f a limf x .

x

a

Using these deﬁnitions and Figure 3-1, answer Problems 1 through 4.

At which of the following x values are all

three requirements for the existence of a

limit satisﬁed, and what is the limit at those

2

For the x values at which all three limit

requirements are not met, state which of

the three requirements are not satisﬁed.

If one or both one-sided limits exist at

any of these x values, give the value of the

one-sided limit.

For the rest of the x values, state which of

Taking a Closer Look: Limit

In this section, you get more practice at solving limit and continuity problems visually. Then

in Chapter 4, you solve limit problems numerically (with your calculator) and symbolically

(with algebra).

Solutions for Limits and Continuity

1

At which of the following x values are all three requirements for the existence of a limit sat-

isﬁed, and what is the limit at those x values? x = –2, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 11.

At 0, the limit is 2.

At 4, the limit is 5.

At 8, the limit is 3.

At 10, the limit is 5.

To make a long story short, a limit exists at a particular x value of a curve when the curve is

heading toward some particular y value and keeps heading toward that y value as you continue

to zoom in on the curve at the x value. The curve must head toward that y value (that height)

as you move along the curve both from the right and from the left (unless the limit is one

where x approaches inﬁnity). I emphasize heading toward because what happens precisely

at the given x value isn’t relevant to this limit inquiry. That’s why there is a limit at a hole

like the ones at x 8 and x 10.

2

For the rest of the x values, state which of the three limit requirements are not satisﬁed. If one

or both one-sided limits exist at any of these x values, give the value of the one-sided limit.

At –2 and 5, all three conditions fail.

At 2, 6, and 11, only the third requirement is not satisﬁed.

At 2, the limit from the left equals 5 and the limit from the right equals 3.

At 6, the limit from the left is 2 and the limit from the right is 3.

Finally, at 11, the limit from the left equals 3 and the limit from the right equals 5.

At which of the x values are all three requirements for continuity satisﬁed?

3

The function in Figure 3-1 is continuous at 0 and 4. The common-sense way of thinking

about continuity is that a curve is continuous wherever you can draw the curve without

taking your pen oﬀ the paper. It should be obvious that that’s true at 0 and 4, but not at any

of the other listed x values.

4

For the rest of the x values, state which of the three continuity requirements are not satisﬁed.

All listed x values other than 0 and 4 are points of discontinuity. A discontinuity is just a

highfalutin calculus way of saying a gap. If you’d have to take your pen oﬀ the paper at

some point when drawing a curve, then the curve has a discontinuity there.

At 5 and 11, all three conditions fail.

At –2, 2, and 6, continuity requirements 2 and 3 are not satisﬁed.

At 10, requirements 1 and 3 are not satisﬁed.

At 8, requirement 3 is not satisﬁed.

the hole. The fact that f 18 is undeﬁned is irrelevant to this limit question.

x

5

of a solid one — when you arrive at the gap. But the hollow dot at 5, 6 is irrelevant to the

limit question — just as in Problem 8 where the hole was irrelevant.

11 List the x coordinates of all discontinuities of f, state whether the discontinuities are remov-

able or nonremovable, and give the type of discontinuity — hole, jump, or inﬁnite.

At x –7, the vertical asymptote, there is a nonremovable, inﬁnite discontinuity.

At x 5, there’s a nonremovable, jump discontinuity.

At x 13 and x 18, there are holes which are removable discontinuities. Though inﬁnitely

small, these are nevertheless discontinuities. They’re “removable” discontinuities because

you can “ﬁx” the function by plugging the holes.

12 lim sin x does not exist. There’s no limit as x approaches inﬁnity because the curve oscillates —

x

it never settles down to one precise y value. (The three-part deﬁnition of a limit does not apply

to limits at inﬁnity.)

farther and farther to the right, the function gets closer and closer to zero, so that’s the limit.

Of course, you can graph f with your graphing calculator, but it’s a good idea to graph func-

tions by hand now and then. It helps you understand why the function looks the way it does.

All you need to do to sketch this one by hand is to plug a few negative and positive numbers

into x. You’ll soon see that whenever the input is negative, the output is –1, and whenever

the input is positive, the output is 1. And you need the hollow dots on the y axis at –1 and 1

because f 0 is undeﬁned. Your sketch should look something like the following ﬁgure.

For the one-sided limit, limf x , nothing to the right of 0 is relevant. And, as with all limit

x

0

problems, what actually happens to the function (namely, whether it exists and, if it exists,

what it equals) when x gets to the limit number doesn’t aﬀect the limit answer. All that mat-

ters is what’s happening to the function as x gets closer and closer to the limit number. As x

gets closer and closer to zero from the left, y is staying precisely at –1, so that’s the limit.

Nitty-Gritty Limit

Problems

I

n this chapter, you practice two very diﬀerent methods for solving limit problems: using

algebra and using your calculator. Learning the algebraic techniques are valuable for two

reasons. The ﬁrst, incredibly important reason is that the mathematics involved in the alge-

braic methods is beautiful, pure, and rigorous; and, second — something so trivial that perhaps

I shouldn’t mention it — you’ll be tested on it. Do I have my priorities straight or what? The

calculator techniques are useful for several reasons: 1) You can solve some limit problems on

your calculator that are either impossible or just very diﬃcult to do with algebra, 2) You can

check your algebraic answers with your calculator, and 3) Limit problems can be solved with a

calculator when you’re not required to show your work — like maybe on a multiple-choice test.

But before you get to these two major techniques, a little rote learning is in order. A few limits

are a bit tricky to justify or prove, so to make your life easier, simply commit them to memory.

Here they are:

Solving Limits with Algebra

You can solve limit problems with several algebraic techniques (discussed later). But before

you try any algebra, your ﬁrst step should always be to plug the arrow-number into the limit

expression. If the function is continuous at the arrow-number (which it usually will be) and if

plugging in results in an ordinary number, then that’s the answer. You’re done. For example,

Pulling Out Your Calculator: Useful “Cheating”

Your calculator is a great tool for understanding limits. It can often give you a better feel for

how a limit works than the algebraic techniques can. A limit problem asks you to determine

what the y value of a function is zeroing in on as the x value approaches a particular number.

With your calculator, you can actually witness the process and the result. You can solve a limit

problem with your calculator in three diﬀerent ways:

»

Method I: First, store a number into x that’s extremely close to the arrow-number, enter

the limit expression in the home screen, and hit enter. If you get a result really close to a

round number, that’s your answer — you’re done. If you have any doubt about the answer,

just store another number into x that’s even closer to the arrow-number, get back to the

limit expression, and hit enter again. This will likely give you a result even closer to the same

round number — that’s it; you’ve got it. This method can be the quickest, but it often doesn’t

give you a good feel for how the y values zero in on the result. To get a better picture of this

process, you can store three or four numbers into x (one after another), each a bit closer to

the arrow-number, and look at the sequence of results.

CHAPTER 4 Nitty-Gritty Limit Problems

59





»

»

Method II: Enter the limit expression in graphing or “y ” mode, go to Table Setup, set

Tblstart to the arrow-number, and set ΔTbl to something small like 0.01 or 0.001. When you

look at the table, you’ll often see the y values getting closer and closer to the limit answer

as x homes in on the arrow-number. If it’s not clear what the y values are approaching, try a

smaller increment for the ΔTbl number. This method often gives you a good feel for what’s

happening in a limit problem.

Method III: This method gives you the best visual understanding of how a limit works. Enter

the limit expression in graphing or “y ” mode. (If you’re using the second method, you may

want to try this third method at the same time.) Next, graph the function, and then go into

the window and tweak the xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax settings, if necessary, so that the part

of the function corresponding to the arrow-number is within the viewing window. Use the

trace feature to trace along the function until you get close to the arrow-number. You can’t

trace exactly onto the arrow-number because there’s a little hole in the function there, the

height of which, by the way, is your answer. When you trace close to the arrow-number,

the y value will get close to the limit answer. Use the ZoomBox feature to draw a little box

around the part of the graph containing the arrow-number and zoom in until you see that

the y values are getting very close to a round number — that’s your answer.

Making Yourself a Limit Sandwich

The sandwich or squeeze method is something you can try when you can’t solve a limit problem

with algebra. The basic idea is to ﬁnd one function that’s always greater than the limit function

(at least near the arrow-number) and another function that’s always less than the limit func-

tion. Both of your new functions must have the same limit as x approaches the arrow-number.

Then, because the limit function is “sandwiched” between the other two, like salami between

slices of bread, it must have that same limit as well. See Figure 4-1.

in the “Solving Limits with Algebra” section of this chapter in order to change the limit expres-

sion so that you can plug in and solve.

Case 2: If the degrees of the two polynomials are equal, there’s a horizontal asymptote

at the number you get when you divide the coeﬃcient of the highest power term in the

numerator by the coeﬃcient of the highest power term in the denominator. This number is

the answer to the limit as x approaches inﬁnity or negative inﬁnity. By the way, if the degree

of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there’s no horizontal

asymptote and no limit.

Consider the following four types of expressions: x10, 5x, x! , and xx . If a limit at inﬁnity

involves a fraction with one of them over another, you can apply a handy little tip. These four

expressions are listed from “smallest” to “largest.” (This isn’t a true ordering; it’s only for

problems of this type; and note that the actual numbers don’t matter; they could just as eas-

ily be x8 , 30x , x! , and xx .) The limit will equal 0 if you have a “smaller” expression over a

“larger” one, and the limit will equal inﬁnity if you have a “larger” expression over a “smaller”

one. And this rule is not aﬀected by coeﬃcients.

5

This probably seems like an odd problem, because there’s no x in the limit expression for you

to plug the 5 into. Think of it this way. The 8 represents the function y 8, which is a hori-

zontal line at a height of 8. The limit problem asks you to determine what y is getting closer

and closer to along the function as x gets closer and closer to 5. But, since the function is a

horizontal line, y is always equal to 8 regardless of the value of x. Thus,

Don’t forget that for all calculus problems, constants behave like ordinary numbers. In

Problem 14, the 8 represented the horizontal line y 8, so in this problem, the k represents

the horizontal line y k. So, y is always at a height of k regardless of the value of x. Thus, the

limit equals k.

easy to do with algebra.

CHAPTER 4 Nitty-Gritty Limit Problems

19 lim x sin

\0.

x

2

x

0

Here are three ways to do this. First, common sense should tell you that this limit equals 0.

1

x

limx is 0, of course, and lim sin

never gets bigger than 1 or smaller than –1. You could

2

x

0

x

0

1

say that lim sin

, therefore, is “bounded” (it’s bounded by –1 and 1). Then, because

x

2

x

0

zero bounded zero, the limit is 0. Don’t try this logic with you calc teacher — he won’t

like it.

Second, you can use your calculator: Store something small like 0.1 into x and then input

1

x 2

x sin

into your home screen and hit enter. You should get a result of ~ 0.05. Now store 0.01

1

into x and use the entry button to get back to x sin

and hit enter again. The result is ~ 0.003.

x 2

Now try 0.001, then 0.0001 (giving you ~ 0.00035 and ~ 0.00009), and so on. It’s pretty

clear — though probably not to the satisfaction of your professor — that the limit is 0.

The third way will deﬁnitely satisfy those typically persnickety professors. You’ve got to

1

x 2

sandwich (or squeeze) your salami function, x sin

, between two bread functions that have

identical limits as x approaches the same arrow-number it approaches in the salami function.

1

x 2

1

x 2

Because sin

never gets greater than 1 or less than –1, x sin

will never get greater than

x or less than x . (You need the absolute value bars, by the way, to take care of negative

values of x.) This suggests that you can use b x

x for the bottom piece of bread and

1

x 2

1

t x x as the top piece of bread. Graph b x

x , f x

x sin

, and t x

x at the

same time on your graphing calculator and you can see that x sin

is always greater than or

x 2

equal to x and always less than or equal to x . Because lim

x

0 and lim x 0, and

x

x

because x sin

For lim x2 cos

thing is always between –1 and 1, so x2 cos is sandwiched between those two bread func-

tions. (You should conﬁrm this by looking at their graphs; use the following window on your

graphing calculator — Radian mode, xMin = –0.15625, xMax = 0.15625, xScl = 0.05, yMin =

1

x

–0.0125, yMax = 0.0125, yScl = 0.005.) Because lim x 2

According to the “larger” over “smaller” tip, this answer must be inﬁnity. Or you can get

this result with your calculator. If you set the table (don’t forget: fork on the left, spoon on

the right) with something like tblStart = 100 and Δtbl = 100, and then look at the table, you

may see “undef” for some or all of the y values, depending on your calculator model. You

have to be careful when trying to interpret what “undef” (for “undeﬁned”) means on your

calculator. It often means inﬁnity, but not always, so don’t just jump to that conclusion.

Instead, make tblStart and Δtbl smaller, say, 10. Sure enough, the y values grow huge very

fast, and you can safely conclude that the limit is inﬁnity.

It may seem strange, but inﬁnity minus inﬁnity does not equal 0.

27 lim cos x

does not exist (DNE).

x

The best approach to this limit problem is to simply sketch or picture the graph of the

cosine function (or graph it on your graphing calculator). As x moves left toward negative

inﬁnity, the cosine curve oscillates between heights of –1 and 1. The curve never

approaches a single height; the oscillation goes on forever. This tells you that lim cosx

x

does not exist (and, by the same reasoning, lim cosx DNE). The function in this problem,

x

lim cos x2 , has a diﬀerent shape than

, but it oscillates forever in the same way

x

between heights of –1 and 1 (it oscillates faster and faster the further out you go toward

inﬁnity or negative inﬁnity). Thus, cos x2 does not exist (DNE).

sin x

x

28 lim

x

Like lim cosx, lim sinx DNE because the sine function oscillates forever between heights of –1

x

x

and 1 as x gets larger and larger. But it doesn’t follow that the answer to the current problem

sinx

is also DNE. The function,

, does oscillate forever as x gets larger and larger, but the

x

amplitude of the oscillation gets damped more and more as x gets larger. Near x 100, for

sinx

example, the amplitude of the oscillation gets divided by about 100, so

oscillates

x

sinx

between heights of about –0.01 and 0.01. Near x 1000,

oscillates between about –0.001

x

and 0.001, and so on. The crests and troughs of the oscillating wave get smaller and smaller

and closer and closer to a height of zero. That’s the limit: zero.

No work required here. This is one of the handful of limits you should just memorize.

Since the number e came up here, I can’t resist mentioning what some say is the most ele-

current problem is to manipulate the limit with the 3x in it until you get something that

resembles the solution from Problem 29. Here’s what you do:

Now, use the power-to-a-power rule:

See how this limit resembles the limit from Problem 29? You’re almost there. The next step

is to set u equal to 3x so you can replace each 3x with a u. And, because u 3x, as x approaches

inﬁnity, so does u; thus, you can replace the x below the lim symbol with a u:

u

1

u

3

lim 1

y

u

Finally, this limit is mathematically identical to the one from Problem 29, which equals e.

Therefore

But you need y, not y3, because you set the limit you wanted equal to y. Cube root both sides,

and you’re done:

Diﬀerentiation Basics

D

iﬀerentiation is the process of ﬁnding derivatives. The derivative is one of the most

important inventions in the history of mathematics and one of mathematics’ most

powerful tools. I’m sure you will feel a deep privilege as you do the practice problems

below — and also a keen sense of indebtedness to the great mathematicians of the past. Yeah,

yeah, yeah.

The Derivative: A Fancy Calculus Word

for Slope and Rate

The derivative of a function tells you how fast the output variable (like y) is changing compared

to the input variable (like x). For example, if y is increasing 3 times as fast as x — like with the

line y 3x 5 — then you say that the derivative of y with respect to x equals 3, and you write

dy

dx

run

The following problems emphasize the fact that a derivative is basically just a rate or a slope.

So to solve these problems, all you have to do is answer the questions as if they had asked you

to determine a rate or a slope instead of a derivative.

A. The answer is 4. You know, of course, that

the slope of y 4x 5 is 4, right? No? Egad!

Any line of the form y mx b has a slope

equal to m. I hope that rings a bell. The deriv-

ative of a line or curve is the same thing as its

slope, so the derivative of this line is 4.

The Handy-Dandy Diﬀerence Quotient

The diﬀerence quotient is the almost-magical tool that gives us the slope of a curve at a single

point. To make a long story short, here’s what happens when you use the diﬀerence quotient.

(If you want an excellent version of the long story, check out Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition.)

Look again at the ﬁgure in Problem 3. You can see that the slope of the parabola at (7, 9) equals

3, the slope of the tangent line. But you can’t calculate that slope with the algebra slope formula

y2

x2 x1

y1

m

, because no matter what other point on the parabola you use with (7, 0) to plug

into the formula, you’ll get a slope that’s steeper or less steep than the precise slope of 3 at (7, 9).

But if your second point on the parabola were extremely close to (7, 9) — like 7.001, 9.0029996 —

your line would be almost exactly as steep as the tangent line. The diﬀerence quotient gives the

precise slope of the tangent line by sliding the second point closer and closer to (7, 9) until its

distance from (7, 9) is inﬁnitely small.

Enough of this mumbo jumbo; now for the math. Here’s the deﬁnition of the derivative based

on the diﬀerence quotient:

so that you can cancel the h and then plug in. (The techniques from Chapter 4 also work here.)

If you leave your home at time = 0, and speed away in your car at 60

derivative of your position with respect to time? The answer is

A derivative is always a rate, and (assuming we’re talking about instantaneous rates, not

average rates) a rate is always a derivative. So, if your speed, or rate, is 60

, the

dp

derivative,

, is also 60.

Using the information from Problem 1, write a function that gives your position as a function

of time. p t 60t or p 60t, where t is in hours and p is in miles.

If you plug 1 into t, your position is 60 miles; plug 2 into t and your position is 120 miles.

60t is a line, of course, in the form y mx b (where b 0 because you started your trip at

p

your home where your position is zero). So the slope is 60 and the derivative is thus 60. And,

again, you see that a derivative is a slope and a rate.

, at the

point 7, 9 . You know from y mx b that the slope of y 3x 12 is 3. At the point 7, 9 , the

parabola is exactly as steep as the line, so the derivative (that’s the slope) of the parabola at

7, 9 is also 3.

Although the slope of the line stays constant, the slope of the parabola changes as you climb

up from 7, 9 , getting less and less steep. Even if you go to the right just 0.001 to x 7.001,

the slope will no longer be exactly 3.

What’s the derivative of the parabola y

x2 5 at the point 0, 5 ? The answer is 0.

x2 5. At the top, the parabola is neither

The point 0, 5 is the very top of the parabola, y

going up nor down — just like you’re neither going up nor down the moment when you walk

across the crest of a hill. The top of the parabola is ﬂat or level in this sense, and thus the

slope and derivative both equal zero.

The fact that the derivative is zero at the top of a hill (and at the bottom of a valley) is a

critically important point which you’ll return to time and time again.

With your graphing calculator, graph both the line y

5

x2.

a. What is the derivative of y

5

x2 when x 2? The answer is –4.

The derivative of a curve tells you its slope or steepness. Because the line and the parabola

are equally steep at 2, 1 , and because you know the slope of the line is –4, the slope of

the parabola at 2, 1 is also –4 and so is its derivative.

b. On the parabola, how fast is y changing compared to x when x 2? It’s decreasing 4 times

as fast as x increases.

84

PART 3 Diﬀerentiation





A derivative is a rate as well as a slope. Because the derivative of the parabola is –4 at

2, 1 , that tells you that y is changing 4 times as fast as x, but because the 4 is negative,

y decreases 4 times as fast as x increases. This is the rate of y compared to x only for the one

instant at 2, 1 — and thus it’s called an instantaneous rate. A split second later — say at

x

2.000001 — y will be decreasing a bit faster.

6

Draw a function containing three points where — for three diﬀerent reasons — you would

not be able to determine the slope and thus where you would not be able to ﬁnd a derivative.

Your sketch of a function should contain

\1. Any type of gap or discontinuity. There’s no slope and thus no derivative at a gap in a

function because you can’t draw a tangent line at a gap (try it).

\2. A sharp, pointy turn in the function (like the one in the second graph of Figure 7-1 in

Chapter 7 where the absolute minimum is; that type of pointy turn is called a corner by the

way; a super pointy turn — kind of like the tip of a needle — is called a cusp). It’s impos-

sible to draw a tangent line at a corner or a cusp because a line touching the function at

such a sharp point could rock back and forth like a teeter-totter. So there’s no slope and

no derivative at a cusp.

\3. A vertical inﬂection point. Although you can draw a tangent line at a vertical inﬂection

point, the derivative there is undeﬁned because the slope of a vertical line is undeﬁned.

Rules for Beginners

Okay, now that you’ve got the memorization stuﬀ taken care, you can begin working with some

rules that involve more than just memorizing the answer.

First, there’s the rule for the derivative of a constant: The derivative of a constant is zero. All

right — this one’s also just memorization.

And then there’s the power rule: To ﬁnd the derivative of a variable raised to a power, bring

the power in front — multiplying it by the coeﬃcient, if there is one — and then reduce the

power by one.

Q. What’s the derivative of 5x3?

A. 15x .

\1. Bring the power in front, multiplying it by the coeﬃcient.

That ﬁrst step gives you 15x3. Note that this does not equal 5x3 so you should not

put an equal sign in front of it. In fact, there’s no reason to write this interim step

down at all. I do it simply to make the process clear.

Giving It Up for the Product and Quotient Rules

Now that you’ve got the easy stuﬀ down, I’m sure you’re dying to get some practice with

advanced diﬀerentiation rules. The product rule and the quotient rule give you the derivatives

for the product of two functions and the quotient of two functions, respectively and obviously.

The product rule is a snap. The derivative of a product of two functions, first second , equals

first second

first second .

first

The quotient rule is also a piece of cake. The derivative of a quotient of two functions,

,

Here’s a good way to remember the quotient rule. When you read a product, you read from left

to right, and when you read a quotient, you read from top to bottom. So just remember that the

quotient rule, like the product rule, works in the natural order in which you read, beginning

with the derivative of the ﬁrst thing you read. For some mysterious reason, many textbooks

give the quotient rule in a diﬀerent form that’s harder to remember. Learn it the way I’ve writ-

ten it above, beginning with first . That’s the easiest way to remember it. Also note that when

the two rules are written as they are above, the numerator of the quotient rule looks exactly like

the product rule, except that there’s a minus sign instead of a plus sign.

Linking Up with the Chain Rule

The chain rule is probably the trickiest among the advanced rules, but it’s really not that bad

at all if you focus clearly on what’s going on. Most of the basic derivative rules have a plain old

x as the argument (or input variable) of the function. For example, f x

all have just x as the argument.

x , sinx, and y ex

When the argument of a function is anything other than a plain old x, such as y sin x2 or

ln10x (as opposed to lnx), you’ve got a chain rule problem.

Here’s what you do. You simply apply the derivative rule that’s appropriate to the outer func-

tion, temporarily ignoring the not-a-plain-old-x argument. Then multiply that result by the

derivative of the argument. That’s all there is to it.

Q. What’s the derivative of y sin x

What to Do with Y’s: Implicit Diﬀerentiation

You use implicit diﬀerentiation when your equation isn’t in “y ” form, such assin y 2

x3 5y3,

and it’s impossible to solve for y. If you can solve for y, implicit diﬀerentiation will still work,

but it’s not necessary.

Implicit diﬀerentiation problems are chain rule problems in disguise. Here’s what I mean. You

know that the derivative of sinx is

, and that according to the chain rule, the derivative of

sin x3 is cos x3 x3 . You would ﬁnish that problem by doing the derivative of x3, but I have

a reason for leaving the problem unﬁnished here.

To do implicit diﬀerentiation, all you do (sort of) is every time you see a “y” in a problem, you

treat it like the x3 is treated above. Thus, because the derivative of sin x3 is cos x 3

x3 , the

derivative of sin y is cosy y . Then, after doing the diﬀerentiation, you just solve for y so that

you get y something.

By the way, I used “y” in the preceding explanation, but that’s not the whole story. Consider

dy

dx

that y 20x3 is the same as

20x3. It’s the variable on the top that you apply implicit dif-

ferentiation to. This is typically y, but it could be any other variable. And it’s the variable on

the bottom that you treat the ordinary way. This is typically x, but it could also be any other

variable.

Getting High on Calculus: Higher

Order Derivatives

You often need to take the derivative of a derivative, or the derivative of a derivative of a deriva-

tive, and so on. In the next two chapters, you see a few applications. For example, a second

derivative tells you the acceleration of a moving body. To ﬁnd a higher order derivative, you

just treat the ﬁrst derivative as a new function and take its derivative in the ordinary way. You

can keep doing this indeﬁnitely.

Note that the derivative of plain old t or plain old x (or any other variable) is simply 1. In a

sense, this is the simplest of all derivative rules, not counting the derivative of a constant.

Yet for some reason, many people get it wrong. This is simply an example of the power rule:

x is the same as x1, so you bring the 1 in front and reduce the power by 1, from 1 to 0. That

gives you 1x0. But because anything to the 0 power equals 1, you have 1 times 1, which of

course is 1.

When doing this derivative, you can deal with the “5” in two ways. First, you can ignore it

temporarily, do the diﬀerentiating, then multiply your answer by 5. (If you do it this way,

don’t forget that the “5” multiplies the entire derivative, not just the ﬁrst term.) The second

way is probably easier and better: Just make the “5” part of the ﬁrst function. To wit:

To remember the derivatives of the inverse trig functions, notice that the derivative of each

co-function (arccosine, arccotangent, and arccosecant) is the negative of its corresponding

function. So, you really only need to memorize the derivatives of arcsin, arctan, and arcsec.

These three have a 1 in the numerator. The two that contain the letter “s,” arcsin and arcsec,

This problem involves both the product rule and the chain rule. Which do you do ﬁrst? Note

that the chain rule part of this problem, sin3 x, is one of the two things being multiplied, so it

is part of — or sort of inside — the product. And, like with pure chain rule problems, with

problems involving more than one rule, you work from outside, in. So here you begin with

the product rule. The following tip gives you another way to look at it.

If you’re not sure about the order of the rules in a complicated derivative problem, imagine

that you plugged a number into x in the original function and had to compute the answer.

Your last computation tells you where to start. If, for example, you plugged 2 into x4 sin3 x,

you would compute 24 then sin2, then you’d cube that to get sin3 2, and, ﬁnally, you’d multi-

ply 24 by sin3 2. Because your ﬁnal step was multiplication, you begin with the product rule.

Analy zing Those

Shapely Curves with

the Derivative

T

his chapter gives you lots of practice using the derivative to analyze the shape of curves

and their signiﬁcant features and points. Don’t forget: The derivative tells you the slope

of a curve, so any problem involving anything about the slope or steepness of a curve is

a derivative problem.

The First Derivative Test and Local Extrema

One of the most common applications of the derivative employs the simple idea that at the top

of a hill or at the bottom of a valley, you’re neither going up nor down — at a peak or a val-

ley, the terrain is horizontal. Thus, there’s zero steepness there, and the slope — and thus the

derivative — equal zero. You can therefore use the derivative to locate the top of a “hill” and

the bottom of a “valley,” called local extrema, on just about any function by setting the deriva-

tive of the function equal to zero and solving for x.

PART 3 Diﬀerentiation





\3. Plot the three critical numbers on a number line, noting that they create four

regions (see the ﬁgure in Step 5).

\4. Plug a number from each of the four regions into the derivative, noting whether the

results are positive or negative.

If you’ve already factored the derivative (see Step 2), it’s usually best to use the

factored form of the derivative in this step. And all you need to do is note whether

the results are positive or negative. There’s no need to compute the exact results.

By the way, a very slight shortcut here is to notice that since g x is an even

function, g 1 must equal g 1 and g 4 must equal g 4 .

\5. Draw a “sign graph.” Take your number line and label each region — based on

your results from Step 4 — positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing). See the

following ﬁgure.

© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This sign graph tells you where the function is increasing (rising as you go from

left to right) and where it is decreasing (falling as you go from left to right).

\6. Use the sign graph to determine whether there’s a local minimum, local maximum,

or neither at each critical number.

Because g goes down on its way to x

x

x

3 and up after x

3, so there’s a local min there. Conversely, g peaks at x 3 because it rises until

3, and then falls. There is thus a local max at x 3. And because g climbs on its

3, it must bottom out at

way to x 0 and then climbs further, there is neither a min nor a max at x 0.

\7. Determine the y values of the local extrema by plugging the x values into the

original function.

The Second Derivative Test and Local Extrema

With the second derivative test, you use — can you guess? — the second derivative to test for

local extrema. The second derivative test is based on the absolutely brilliant idea that the crest

of a hill has a hump shape

and the bottom of a valley has a trough shape

.

120

PART 3 Diﬀerentiation





After you ﬁnd a function’s critical numbers, you have to decide whether to use the ﬁrst or the

second derivative test to ﬁnd the extrema. For some functions, the second derivative test is the

easier of the two because 1) the second derivative is usually easy to get, 2) you can often plug

the critical numbers into the second derivative and do a quick computation, and 3) you will

often get non-zero results and thus get your answers without having to do a sign graph and

test regions. On the other hand, testing regions on a sign graph (the ﬁrst derivative test) is also

fairly quick and easy, and if the second derivative test fails (see the warning), you’ll have to do

that anyway. As you do practice problems, you’ll get a feel for when to use each test.

If the second derivative equals zero at a particular critical number, the second derivative test

fails and you learn nothing about whether there’s a local extremum there. When this happens,

you have to use the ﬁrst derivative test to determine whether or not you have a local extremum.

Q. Take the function from the example in the previous section, g x

15x

time ﬁnd its local extrema using the second derivative test.

A. The local min is at x

First, you need the second derivative:

g x

45x2 5x 4

Now all you do is plug in the critical numbers of g from Step 2 of the example in the

preceding section:

g

g

270

The fact that g

there’s a local min there. And the fact that g

down

that g

3

is positive tells you that g is concave up

is negative tells you that g is concave

at x 3, and, therefore, that there’s a local max there. And, while it may seem

0 0 conﬁrms what you ﬁgured out previously (that there’s neither a min nor a

at x

3, and thus that

3

max at x 0), you actually learn nothing when the second derivative is zero; you have to

use the ﬁrst derivative test instead.

If, like here, you only have one critical point between a local min and a local max (and no dis-

continuities), it has to be an inﬂection point. And if you have a single critical number between

two known maxes (see Problem 7), the only possibility for the middle critical number is a local

min (and vice versa). So in these cases, it really doesn’t matter if the second derivative test fails

with the middle critical number. If this not-by-the-book reasoning doesn’t work for your calc

teacher, you might say (with just a touch of sarcasm in your voice), “Oh, so in other words,

you’ve got something against logic and common sense.”

is easier to analyze with the second deriva-

use the second derivative test to ﬁnd its local

extrema.

Finding Mount Everest: Absolute Extrema

The basic idea in this section is quite simple. Instead of ﬁnding all local extrema as in the pre-

vious sections (all the peaks and all the valleys), you just want to determine the single highest

point and single lowest point along a continuous function in some closed interval. These absolute

extrema can occur at a peak or valley or at an edge(s) of the interval. (Note: You could have, say,

two peaks at the same height so there’d be a tie for the absolute max; but there would still be

exactly one y value that’s the absolute maximum value on the interval.)

Before you practice with some problems, look at Figure 7-1 to see two standard absolute extrema

problems (continuous functions on a closed interval) and at Figure 7-2 for four strange functions

that don’t have the standard single absolute max and single absolute min.

Smiles and Frowns: Concavity

and Inﬂection Points

Another purpose of the second derivative is to analyze concavity and points of inﬂection. (For a

refresher, look at Figure 7-3: The section of curve between A and B is concave down — like an

upside-down spoon or a frown; the sections on the outsides of A and B are concave up — like a

right-side up spoon or a smile; and A and B are inﬂection points.) A positive second derivative

means concave up; a negative second derivative means concave down. And where the concavity

switches from up to down or down to up (like at A and B), you have an inﬂection point, and the

second derivative there will (usually) be zero.

FIGURE 7-3:

Concavity

and points

of inﬂection.

© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

All inﬂection points have a second derivative of zero (if the second derivative exists), but not all

points with a second derivative of zero are inﬂection points. This is no diﬀerent from “all ships

are boats but not all boats are ships.” (For example, y x4, which resembles a parabola, has a

second derivative equal to zero at the point 0, 0 , but that point is not an inﬂection point — it’s

a local minimum.)

Finally, note that you can have an inﬂection point where the second derivative is undeﬁned.

This occurs when the inﬂection point has a vertical tangent and in some bizarre curves that you

shouldn’t worry about that have a weird discontinuity in the second derivative.

Because the concavity switches

(from down to up or up to down) at

all three “critical numbers” and

because the second derivative exists

at those numbers (from Steps 2

and 3), there are inﬂection points at

those three x values. (If the concav-

The Mean Value Theorem: Go Ahead,

Make My Day

The Mean Value Theorem is based on an incredibly simple idea. Say you go for a one-hour drive

and travel 50 miles. Your average speed, of course, would be 50 mph. The Mean Value Theorem

says that there must be at least one point during your trip when your speed was exactly 50 mph.

But you don’t need a fancy-pants calculus theorem to tell you that. It’s just common sense. If

you went slower than 50 mph the whole way, you couldn’t average 50. And if you went faster

than 50 the whole way (this assumes you’re going faster than 50 at your starting point), your

average speed would be greater than 50. The only way to average 50 is to go exactly 50 the

whole way or to go slower than 50 sometimes and faster than 50 at other times. In the former

case, the theorem is obviously satisﬁed because you’re driving at exactly 50 at every point in

time. And in the latter case, the theorem is also satisﬁed because when you speed up or slow

down from going slower than 50 to going faster than 50 (or vice versa), you have to hit exactly

50 mph at some point — you can’t jump, say, from 49 mph one moment to 51 mph the next

moment — your speed has to slide up (or down) and hit precisely 50 mph at some point in time.

With the Mean Value Theorem, you ﬁgure an average rate or slope over an interval and then

use the ﬁrst derivative to ﬁnd one or more points in the interval where the instantaneous rate

or slope equals the average rate or slope. Here’s an example:

Q. Given f x

\6. Determine whether there’s a local min or max or neither at each critical number.

f goes down to where x 0 and then up, so there’s a local min at x 0, and f goes up to

where x 1 and then down, so there’s a local max at x 1.

The second derivative test fails at x 0, so you have to use the ﬁrst derivative test for

that critical number. And this means, basically, that the second derivative test was a

waste of time for this function.

If — as in the function for this problem — one of the critical numbers is x 0, and you can

see that the second derivative will equal zero at x 0 (because, for example, all the terms of

the second derivative will be simple powers of x), then the second derivative test will fail for

x

0, and it will likely be a waste of time. You should use the ﬁrst derivative test instead.

However, because this problem involves a continuous function and because there’s only one criti-

cal number between the two maxes you found, the only possibility is that there’s a min at x 0.

(Try this streetwise logic out on your teacher and let me know if it works.)

Consider the function from problem 3, y

. Which

is easier to analyze with the second derivative test, and why? For the function you pick, use

the second derivative test to ﬁnd its local extrema. Your pick should be s

The second derivative test fails where the second derivative is undeﬁned (in addition to

failing where the second derivative equals zero).

Do you see the trouble you’re going to run into with y x ? The ﬁrst derivative is undeﬁned at

2 2 . And the second derivative will also be undeﬁned at those x values, because when

x

you take the second derivative with the quotient rule, squaring the bottom, the denominator

will contain that same factor, x2 8 . The second derivative test will thus fail at 2 2, and

you’ll have to use the ﬁrst derivative test. In contrast to y x , the second derivative test

works great with s t :

If you divide both sides of an equation by something that can equal zero at one or more

more solutions. You have to check whether any of those x values is a solution. In this

you couldn’t use Line 5 for the check.)

Whoops, I guess this algebra’s kind of messy. Better get the zeros on your calculator: Just

graph and ﬁnd the x intercepts. There are two: x 0.085 and x 0.085. So you have two

“critical numbers,” right? Wrong! Don’t forget to check for undeﬁned points of the second

Thus the concavity goes down, up, down, up. Because the second derivative is zero at –0.085

and 0.085 and because the concavity switches there, you can conclude that there are

inﬂection points at those two x values. But because both the ﬁrst and second derivatives

are undeﬁned at x 0, you have to check whether there’s a vertical tangent there. You can

see that there is by just looking at the graph, but if you want to be rigorous about it, you

ﬁgure the limit of the ﬁrst derivative as x approaches zero. Since that equals inﬁnity, you

have a vertical tangent at x 0, and thus there’s an inﬂection point there.

Now plug in –0.085, 0, and 0.085 into q to get the y values, and you’re done.

Using Diﬀerentiation

to Solve Practical

Problems

N

ow that you’re an expert at ﬁnding derivatives, I’m sure you can’t wait to put your

expertise to use solving some practical problems. In this section, you ﬁnd problems

that actually come up in the real world — problems like how a cat rancher should

use 200 feet of fencing to build a three-sided corral next to a river (he only needs three sides

because the river makes the fourth side and cats hate water) to maximize the grazing area for

his cats.

Optimization Problems: From Soup to Nuts

Optimization problems are one of the most practical types of calculus problems. You use the

techniques discussed below whenever you want to maximize or minimize something, such as

maximizing proﬁt or area or volume or minimizing cost or energy consumption, and so on.

Q. A rancher has 400 feet of fencing and

wants to build a corral that’s divided

into three equal rectangles. See the

following ﬁgure. What length and

width will maximize the area?

\3. Determine the domain of the

function.

You can’t have a negative length of

fence, so x can’t be negative. And if

you build the ridiculous corral with

Problematic Relationships: Related Rates

Related rates problems are the Waterloo for many a calculus student. But they’re not that bad

after you get the basic technique down. The best way to get the hang of them is by working

through lots of examples, so let’s get started.

After working each problem, ask yourself whether the answer makes sense. Asking this ques-

tion is one of the best things you can do to increase your success in mathematics and science.

And while it’s not always possible to decide whether a math answer is reasonable, when it’s

possible, this inquiry should be a quick, extra step of every problem you do.

Q. A homeowner decides to paint his

home. He picks up a home improve-

ment book, which recommends that

a ladder should be placed against a

wall such that the distance from the

foot of the ladder to the bottom of

the wall is one third the length of

the ladder. Not being the sharpest

tool in the shed, the homeowner

gets mixed up and thinks that it’s

© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

the distance from the top of the

ladder to the base of the wall that

should be a third of the ladder’s

length. He sets up his 18-foot ladder

accordingly, and — despite this

unstable ladder placement — he

manages to climb the ladder and

start painting. (Perhaps the foot of

the ladder is caught on a tree root or

something.) His luck doesn’t last

long, and the ladder begins to slide

rapidly down the wall. One foot

before the top of the ladder hits

the ground, it’s falling at a rate of

20 feet/second. At this moment,

how fast is the foot of the ladder

moving away from the wall?

You don’t have to draw the house —

the basic triangle is enough. But

I’ve sketched a fuller picture of this

scenario to make clear what a bone-

head this guy is.

\2. List all given rates and the rate you’re

asked to ﬁgure out. Write these rates as

derivatives with respect to time.

You’re told that the ladder is falling at

a rate of 20 ft/sec. Going down is

negative, so

h is the distance from the top of the

ladder to the bottom of the wall; b is

the distance from the base of the

ladder to the wall.

\1. Draw a diagram, labeling it with

any unchanging measurements

and assigning variables to any

changing things.

See the following ﬁgure.

150

PART 3 Diﬀerentiation





\3. Write down the formula that con-

nects the variables in the problem,

h and b.

(Obviously, you can reject the

negative answer.)

Now you have what you need to

ﬁnish the problem.

That’s the Pythagorean Theorem,

of course: a2 b2 c2, thus

\6. Ask yourself whether your answer is

reasonable.

Yes, it does make sense. Hold a

yardstick against a wall so the

bottom of it is on the ﬂoor and the

top of it is on the wall about 4 or

5 inches from the ﬂoor. Then push

the top of the yardstick 4 or

5 inches down to the ﬂoor. You’ll

see that the bottom would barely

move farther out from the wall.

Right triangles with a ﬁxed hypot-

enuse like this one always work like

that. If one leg is much shorter than

the other, the short leg can change

a lot while the long leg barely

changes. It’s a by-product of the

Pythagorean Theorem.

A farmer’s hog trough is 10 feet long, and its

cross-section is an isosceles triangle with a

base of 2 feet and a height of 2 feet 6 inches

at a rate of 1 cubic foot per minute. Just as

the swill reaches the brim, her three hogs

start violently sucking down the swill at a

A pitcher delivers a fastball, which the batter

pops up — it goes straight up above home

plate. When it reaches a height of 60 feet,

it’s moving up at a rate of 50 feet per second.

the ball to second base growing? Note: The

distance between the bases of a baseball dia-

mond is 90 feet.

They’re going at it so vigorously that another

hogs. When the depth of the swill falls to

falling?

A 6-foot tall man looking over his shoulder

sees his shadow that’s cast by a 15-foot-tall

lamppost in front of him. The shadow

frightens him so he starts running away

from it — toward the lamppost.

Unfortunately, this only makes matters

worse, as it causes the frightening head of

the shadow to gain on him. He starts to panic

and runs even faster. Five feet before he

crashes into the lamppost, he’s running at a

speed of 15 miles per hour. At this point, how

fast is the tip of the shadow moving?

Salt is being unloaded onto a conical pile at a

rate of 200 cubic feet per minute. If the

height of the cone-shaped pile is always

equal to the radius of the cone’s base, how

fast is the height of the pile increasing when

it’s 18 feet tall?

PART 3 Diﬀerentiation





A Day at the Races: Position,

Velocity, and Acceleration

The most important thing to know about this type of problem is that velocity is the derivative

of position, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity. The following points about position,

velocity, and acceleration with regard to the chariot race in Figure 8-1 provide some keys to

approaching these problems.

FIGURE 8-1:

A 200-

palameter

chariot race.

© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

»

The ﬁnish is 100 palameters from the start as the crow ﬂies, so 100 palameters is the total

displacement. (A palameter is a little-known unit of distance used in ancient Rome equal to

the length of Julius Caesar’s palace — roughly 380 feet.) Say the start is at 0, 0 on a coordi-

nate system and the ﬁnish is at 100, 0 . It’s 100 from 0 to 100, of course, so 100 is the total

displacement.

»

»

Distance is diﬀerent. You can see that the charioteers backtrack 50 palameters in the middle

of the race. Because there are two extra 50-palameter legs, the total length of the race is

200 palameters — that’s the distance. Distance is always positive or zero.

Displacement to the left is negative (in other problems, down would be negative). When,

say, Maximus passes Atlas, his position is 75 palameters from the start. At Aphrodite, he’s

back to only 25 palameters from the start as the crow ﬂies. Displacement equals ﬁnal posi-

tion minus initial position, so from Atlas to Aphrodite is a displacement of 25 75, or –50

palameters.

»

Velocity is related to displacement, not distance traveled. Velocity has a special meaning in

calculus and physics so forget the everyday meaning of it. Like displacement, if you’re going

left (or down), that’s a negative velocity. And here’s a critical point: When you switch direc-

tions, your velocity is zero. Think of a ball thrown straight up. At its peak, for an inﬁnitesimal

moment, it is motionless, so its velocity is zero.

CHAPTER 8 Using Diﬀerentiation to Solve Practical Problems

153

»

Average velocity is deﬁned as total displacement divided by total time. Say Glutius completes

the race in half an hour. Because he travels 200 palameters, his average speed is 400 palam-

eters per hour. But because the total displacement is only 100, his average velocity is a mere

200 palameters per hour (roughly 14 miles per hour).

Speed is regular old speed, and, unlike velocity, it’s always positive (or zero). If Maximus picks

up speed to make the jump over the lion pit, his speed, naturally, increases. Note, however,

that his velocity is decreasing — even though you see him speeding up — because his veloc-

ity is negative and is becoming a larger and larger negative.

And here’s the deal with acceleration (for calculus and physics): A positive acceleration means

the velocity is increasing, and a negative acceleration means the velocity is decreasing. When

you apply this deﬁnition to motion to the right or up, it seems sensible. But when you’re

dealing with motion to the left or down, it seems strange. When Glutius speeds up to jump

over the lion pit, you would say, in day-to-day speech, that he’s accelerating. But because

he’s going left, his velocity is negative, and — since he’s speeding up — his velocity is becom-

ing a larger and larger negative. His velocity, therefore, is decreasing, and that means his

acceleration is negative. Again, he’s speeding up, but his acceleration is negative — seems

weird, but that’s the way it works. For calculus (and physics), because of this issue concerning

motion to the right or up versus motion to the left or down, it’d probably be best to avoid the

use of the terms accelerating and decelerating. Instead, use the following terms: positive accel-

eration, negative acceleration, positive velocity, negative velocity, speeding up, and slowing down.

For Problems 9, 10, and 11, a duck-billed platypus is swimming back and forth along the side

of your boat, blithely unaware that he’s the subject for calculus problems in rectilinear motion.

The back of your boat is at the zero position, and the front of your boat is in the positive direc-

tion (see the following ﬁgure). s t gives the platypus’s position (in feet) as a function of time

(seconds). Find his a) position, b) velocity, c) speed, and d) acceleration, at t 2 seconds.

and t 5, for each problem, ﬁnd a) the intervals when he’s moving away from the trunk, the

intervals when he’s moving toward the trunk, and when and where he turns around; b) his

That’s about 15 ounces. The can will be 2 1.63 or about 31 4 inches wide and

or about 31 4 inches tall. Isn’t that nice? The largest can has the same width and height

and would thus ﬁt perfectly into a cube. Geometric optimization problems frequently have

results where the dimensions have some nice, simple mathematical relationship to each

other.

By the way, did you notice that I skipped evaluating the volume at the endpoints of the

domain? Can you guess why I did that? Hint: What’s the volume for the smallest and larg-

est value of the radius?

What dimensions will minimize the cost of the frame? The dimensions are about 4 3 wide

You know C 2.143

$373 is a min (not a max) because the cost goes up to $423 as x

increases from 2.143, and as x decreases to zero, the cost also goes up (imagine plugging

some tiny number like x = 0.001 into C x ; you get an enormous cost).

So, the least expensive frame for a 20-square-foot window will cost about $373 and will be

Given that a right triangle’s hypotenuse must pass through the point 2, 5 , what are the

dimensions and area of the smallest such triangle? The hypotenuse meets the y axis at

0, 10 and the x axis at 4, 0 , and the triangle’s area is 20.

to the whole triangle. (You can prove their similarity with AA — remember your geom-

etry? — both triangles have a right angle and both share the top angle.)

When the depth of the swill falls to 1 foot 8 inches, how fast is the swill level falling? It’s

falling at a rate of

inches per minute.

\1. Draw a diagram, labeling the diagram with any unchanging measurements and assigning

variables to any changing things.

See the following ﬁgure.

© John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Note that the ﬁgure shows the unchanging dimensions of the trough, 2 feet by 2 feet 6

inches by 10 feet, and these dimensions are not labeled with variable names like l (for

length), w (for width), or h (for height). Also note that the changing things — the height

(or depth) of the swill and the width of the surface of the swill (which gets narrower as

the swill level falls) — do have variable names, h for height and b for base (I realize it’s at

the top, but it’s the base of the upside-down triangle shape made by the swill). Finally,

note that the height of 1 foot 8 inches — which is the height only at one particular point

in time — is in parentheses to distinguish it from the other unchanging dimensions.

CHAPTER 8 Using Diﬀerentiation to Solve Practical Problems

\2. List all given rates and the rate you’re asked to ﬁgure out.

Express these rates as derivatives with respect to time. Give yourself a high-ﬁve if you

realized that the thing that matters about the changing volume of swill is the net rate of

change of volume.

1

Swill is coming in at 1 cubic foot per minute and is going out at 3

cubic feet per minute

2

1

2

(for the three hogs) plus another cubic feet per minute (the splashing). So the net is 1

cubic foot per minute going out — that’s a negative rate of change. In calculus language,

you write:

dV

dt

1 cubic foot per minute

You’re asked to determine how fast the height is changing, so write:

dh

dt

?

\3. a. Write down a formula that involves the variables in the problem: V, h, and b.

The technical name for the shape of the trough is a right prism. And the shape of the

swill in the trough — what you care about here — has the same shape. Imagine tipping

this up so it stands vertically. Any shape that has a ﬂat base and a ﬂat top and that goes

straight up from base to top has the same volume formula:Volume areabase height.

Note that this “base” is the entire swill triangle and totally diﬀerent from b in the

ﬁgure; also this “height” is totally diﬀerent from the swill height, h.

1

The area of the triangular base equals bh and the height of the prism is 10 feet, so

2

1

2

here’s your formula: V

bh 10 5bh.

Because b doesn’t appear in your list of derivatives in Step 2, you want to get rid of it.

b. Find an equation that relates your unwanted variable, b, to some other variable in the

problem so you can make a substitution and be left with an equation involving only

V and h.

The triangular face of the swill is the same shape of the triangular side of the trough. If

you remember geometry, you know that such similar shapes have proportional sides. So,

PART 3 Diﬀerentiation





In all related rates problems, make sure you diﬀerentiate (like you do here in Step 4)

before you substitute the values of the variables into the equation (like you do in the next

step when you plug 1 foot 8 inches into h).

\5. Substitute all known quantities into this equation and solve for

Thus, when the swill level drops to a depth of 1 foot 8 inches, it’s falling at a rate of 9

inches per minute. Mmm, mmm, good!

10

\6. Ask whether this answer makes sense.

Unlike the example problem, it’s not easy to come up with a common-sense explanation

of why this answer is or is not reasonable. But there’s another type of check that works

here and in many other related rates problems.

Take a very small increment of time — something much less than the time unit of the

rates used in the problem. This problem involves rates per minute, so use 1 second for your

time increment. Now ask yourself what happens in this problem in 1 second. The swill is

leaving the trough at 1 cubic foot/minute; so in 1 second, 1 60 cubic foot will leave the

trough. What does that do to the swill height? Because of the similar triangles mentioned

in Step 3b, when the swill falls to a depth of 1 foot 8 inches, which is 2 3 of the height of the

trough, the width of the surface of the swill must be 2 of the width of the trough — and

3

1

that comes to 11

feet. So the surface area of the swill is 13

10 feet.

3

Assuming the trough walls are straight (this type of simpliﬁcation always works in this

type of checking process), the swill that leaves the trough would form the shape of a very,

very short box (“box” sounds funny because this shape is so thin; maybe “thin piece of

plywood” is a better image).

The volume of a box equals length width height, thus

1

60

1

10 1 height

3

height 0.00125

This tells you that in 1 second, the height should fall 0.00125 feet or something very close

to it. (This process sometimes produces an exact answer and sometimes an answer with a

very small error.) Now, ﬁnally, see whether this number agrees with the answer. Your

answer was

9

inches/minute. Convert this to feet/second:

When it reaches a height of 60 feet, it’s moving up at a rate of 50 feet per second. At this

point, how fast is the distance from second base to the ball growing? The distance is growing

at about 21.3 feet per second.

Five feet before the man crashes into the lamppost, he’s running at a speed of 15 miles per

Thus, the top of the shadow is moving toward the lamppost at 25 miles per hour (and is

A somewhat unusual twist in this problem is that you never had to plug in the given dis-

tance of 5 feet. This is because the speed of the shadow is independent of the man’s

position.

Don’t forget that a zero of a derivative can be a horizontal inﬂection as well as a local

Because v 0

1 (a leftward velocity) and v 1

5 (a rightward velocity), s 0.385 must be

a turnaround point (and it’s also a local min on the position graph). Does the ﬁrst deriva-

tive test ring a bell?

Thus, the sloth is going left from t 0 sec to t 0.385 sec and right from 0.385 to 5 sec.

His average speed is 645.43 5, or about 129.1 meters/second. That’s one fast sloth!

Almost 300 miles per hour.

Reject the negative solution because it’s outside the interval of interest: t 0 to t 5. So,

the only zero velocity occurs at t 1.236 seconds.

Because v 0

0.25 meters per second and v 5

0.037, the ﬁrst derivative test tells you

that s 1.236 must be a local max and therefore a turnaround point.

The sloth thus goes right from t 0 till t 1.236 seconds; then turns around at s 1.236 ,

or about 0.405 meters to the right of the trunk, and goes left till t 5.

b. His total distance is the sum of the lengths of the two legs:

going right s 1.236 s 0

0.405 0.25

0.155

going left s 5 s 1.236

0.198

Total distance is therefore about 0.155 0.198 0.353 meters. His average speed is thus

about 0.353 5, or 0.071 meters per second. That’s roughly a sixth of a mile/hour —

much more like it for a sloth.

c. Total displacement is deﬁned as ﬁnal position minus initial position, so that’s

And thus his average velocity is about 0.043 5, or −0.0086 meters per second. You’re

Even More Practical

Applications of

Diﬀerentiation

I

n this chapter, you see more ways to use diﬀerentiation to solve real-world problems. The

three general topics here — tangent line and normal line problems, linear approximation,

and business and economics problems — all involve lines tangent to a curve. This shouldn’t

surprise you, because you’re dealing with diﬀerentiation here, which is all about the slope of

a curve (and that’s the same thing as the slope of the line tangent to the curve). The problems

in this chapter are all “practical” applications of diﬀerentiation in a sense, but some of them

are — to be honest — much more likely to be found in a math book than in the real world. But

at the other end of the spectrum, you ﬁnd problems here like the economics problem of ﬁnding

maximum proﬁt. What could be more practical than that?

Make Sure You Know Your Lines:

Tangents and Normals

In everyday life, it’s perfectly normal to go oﬀ on a tangent now and then. In calculus, on the

other hand, there is nothing at all normal about a tangent. You need only note a couple points

before you’re ready to try some problems:

CHAPTER 9 Even More Practical Applications of Diﬀerentiation

»

At its point of tangency, a tangent line has the same slope as the curve it’s tangent to. In

calculus, whenever a problem involves slope, you should immediately think derivative. The

derivative is the key to all tangent line problems.

At its point of intersection to a curve, a normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line drawn

at that same point. When any problem involves perpendicular lines, you use the rule that

perpendicular lines have slopes that are opposite reciprocals. So all you do is use the deriva-

tive to get the slope of the tangent line, and then the opposite reciprocal of that gives you

the slope of the normal line.

Ready to try a few problems? Say, that reminds me. I once had this problem with my carburetor.

I took my car into the shop, and the mechanic told me the problem would be easy to ﬁx, but

when I went back to pick up my car . . . Wait a minute. Where was I?

Q. Find all lines through 1,

4 either tangent to or normal to y x3. For each tangent

line, give the point of tangency and the equation of the line; for the normal lines, give

only the points of normalcy.

A. Point of tangency is 2, 8 ; equation of tangent line is y 12x 16. Points of nor-

malcy are approximately 1.539, 3.645 , 0.335, 0.038 , and 0.250, 0.016 .

Looking Smart with Linear Approximation

Linear approximation is easy to do, and once you get the hang of it, you can impress your

friends by approximating things like 3 70 in your head — like this: Bingo! 4.125. How did I do

it? Look at Figure 9-1 and then at the example to see how I did it.

64

In the third line of the above

equation, I put the 4 in the front of

the right side of the equation

(instead of at the far right, which

might seem more natural) for two

reasons. First, because doing so

makes this equation jibe with the

explanation at the end of Step 2

about starting at 4 and going up

(or down) from there as you move

away from the point of tangency.

And second, to make this equation

agree with the explanation at the

end of Step 4. You’ll see how it all

works in a minute.

is the slope of the tangent line) at

This tells you that — to approxi-

mate cube roots near 64 — you

add (or subtract) 1 48 to 4 for each

increase (or decrease) of one from

\64. For example, the cube root of

65 is about 41 48, the cube root of 66

is about 42 48, or 41 24, the cube root

of 67 is about 43 48, or 41 16, and the

cube root of 63 is about 347 48.

Calculus in the Real World:

Business and Economics

This chapter concerns practical applications of diﬀerentiation. But the topics of the ﬁrst two

sections of the chapter — tangent and normal lines and linear approximation — though cer-

tainly applications of diﬀerentiation, are not exactly practical. So, in this section, you ﬁnally

see honest-to-goodness practical problems about business and economics. Speciﬁcally, you

see problems about marginals: marginal cost, marginal revenue, and marginal proﬁt.

Marginals work exactly like linear approximation. In the example in the previous section on

linear approximation, you take the derivative of y 3 x to ﬁnd that the slope of the tangent line

to y 3 x at 64, 4 is 1 48. And that tells you that if you go one to the right (from 64 to 65) along

y

3 x , the curve goes up approximately 1 48 (from 4 to about 41 48). In economics problems, that

extra bit that you go up (or down) — like that 1 48 — is called a marginal.

Marginal cost tells you the approximate increase in the cost function as you go one to the right

along the function. It thus tells you the approximate cost of producing one more item. Marginal

revenue and marginal proﬁt work the same way. (Marginal cost and marginal revenue are almost

always positive; marginal proﬁt can be positive or negative.)

Marginal cost equals the derivative of the cost function.

Marginal revenue equals the derivative of the revenue function.

Marginal proﬁt equals the derivative of the proﬁt function.

Q. A thingamajob manufacturer ﬁnds that the demand function for his thingamajobs is

where p is the price of a thingamajob and x is the number of thingamajobs demanded.

(Note that a demand function like this can also be called a price function.) The cost of

producing x thingamajobs is given by the function,

C x

4x 1503 x 1,000

Determine the following:

a. the approximate cost of producing the 126th thingamajob

b. the approximate revenue from the 126th thingamajob

c. the approximate proﬁt from the 126th thingamajob

PART 3 Diﬀerentiation





The marginal revenue at x 125 is $8.00, and that represents the approximate extra

revenue generated for the ﬁrm by the sale of the 126th thingamajob. (By the way,

strange as it may seem, this is not the same amount as the price of the 126th thing-

amajob. Don’t sweat this; it has to do with the fact that if 126 thingamajobs are sold,

the price for all 126 thingamajobs would be, in theory, a bit less than if only 125 thing-

amajobs are sold.)

c. $2.00.

Proﬁt equals revenue minus cost, so

That’s the marginal proﬁt function. By the way, I do the above diﬀerentiation because I

want to reinforce the idea that marginal proﬁt is the derivative of the proﬁt function.

But you can get marginal proﬁt more quickly in this problem — since you already have

R x and C

x — by using the fact that

P

R x

You just subtract marginal cost from marginal revenue to get marginal proﬁt.

Finally, ﬁnd the proﬁt generated for the ﬁrm by the sale of the 126th thingamajob.

Thus, the 126th thingamajob generates a proﬁt of $2.00. And here’s another shortcut.

Did you notice that — since you already know R 125 and C 125 — all you needed to

do to get P 125 was to subtract C 125 from R 125 ?

I ﬁnd this result interesting. First, because there are so many normal lines, and second,

because the normal lines from 0, 1 to 0.915, 0.702 , 0, 0 , and 0.915, 0.702 are all short-

est paths (compared to other points in their respective vicinities). The other two normals are

longest paths. This is curious: When a curve is concave away from a point, a normal to the

curve can only be a local shortest path, so you might think that in the current problem,

where y x4 is everywhere concave toward 0, 1 , you could get only locally longest paths. But

it turns out that when a curve is concave toward a point, you can get either a local shortest or

a local longest path.

It’s a bit tricky to ﬁnd the x intercepts for this hairy function. You have to play around

with your calculator’s window settings a bit. And don’t forget that your calculator will

draw vertical asymptotes that look like zeros of the function, but are not. Now, it turns

out that this function has an inﬁnite number of x intercepts (I think). There’s one

between x

18 and –19 and there are more at bigger negatives. And there’s one

between x 97 and 98 and there are more at bigger positives. But these zeros represent

points on the river so far away that they need not be considered. Only three zeros are

plausible candidates for the closest trip to the river. To see the ﬁrst candidate zero, set

xmin

1, xmax 10, xscl 1, ymin

5, ymax 25, and yscl 5. To see the other two,

2, ymax 10, and yscl 1. These zeros are at

set xmin 10, xmax 30, xscl 1, ymin

roughly 6.11, 13.75, and 20.58.

\4. Plug the zeros into the original function to obtain the y coordinates.

You get the following points of normalcy: 6.11, 15.26 , 13.75, 14.32 , and 20.58, 23.80 .

\5. Use the distance formula, D = x2 x1 + y2 y1 , to ﬁnd the distance from our

parched adventurer to the three points of normalcy.

The distances are 14.77 miles to 6.11, 15.26 , 17.07 miles to 13.75, 14.32 , and 14.93

miles to 20.58, 23.80 . Using his trusty compass, he heads mostly south and a little west

to 6.11, 15.26 . An added beneﬁt of this route is that it’s in the direction of his camp.

This negative proﬁt for the 1,601st widget tells you that the ﬁrm would lose money if it were

to produce and sell that widget. Therefore, it will obviously want to produce and sell fewer

widgets than that. See the solution to the next problem.

12 a. How many widgets should be manufactured and sold to maximize the ﬁrm’s proﬁt?

974 widgets.

Like with any maximization problem, to ﬁnd the maximum proﬁt, you set the ﬁrst deriva-

CHAPTER 9 Even More Practical Applications of Diﬀerentiation

Thus, the ﬁrm should produce and sell 974 widgets to maximize proﬁts. (It’s kind of obvi-

ous in this problem that the proﬁt function hits a maximum at this x value; but, if you

want to be more rigorous, you should show that this x value is indeed where a maximum

occurs, as opposed to a minimum or a horizontal inﬂection point.) I did this problem like

any maximization problem, without mentioning marginals. But, as you know, the ﬁrst

derivative of the proﬁt is the marginal proﬁt. So, the preceding math shows that the mar-

ginal proﬁt is zero when 974 widgets are sold. Do you see why the maximum proﬁt should

occur where the marginal proﬁt equals zero?

b. What is the maximum proﬁt? $143,877.52.

Determine the proﬁt function and evaluate it at x 974. (This is a very unusual calculus

Getting into Integration

I

n this chapter, you begin the second major topic in calculus: integration. With integration

you can ﬁnd the total area or volume of weird shapes that, unlike triangles, spheres, cones,

and other basic shapes, don’t have simple area or volume formulas. You can use integra-

tion to total up other things as well. The basic idea is that when you have something (like a

weird shape, say, an hourglass that doesn’t have a volume formula) that you can’t calculate

directly, you use the magic of limits to sort of cut up the thing into an inﬁnite number of tiny,

inﬁnitesimal pieces; you then calculate the volume of each tiny piece, and ﬁnally you add up

the volumes of all the tiny pieces to get the total volume. But before getting into integration,

you’re going to warm up with some easy stuﬀ: pre-pre-pre-calc — the area of rectangles.

By the way, despite the “kid stuﬀ” quip, much of the material in this chapter and the ﬁrst section

of Chapter 11 is both more diﬃcult and less useful than what follows it. If ever there was a time

for the perennial complaint — “What is the point of learning this stuﬀ?” — this is it. Now, some

calculus teachers would give you all sorts of fancy arguments and pedagogical justiﬁcations for

why this material is taught, but, let’s be honest, the sole purpose of teaching these topics is to

inﬂict maximum pain on calculus students. Well, you’re stuck with it, so deal with it. The good

news is that this material will make everything that comes later seem easy by comparison.

Adding Up the Area of Rectangles: Kid Stuﬀ

The material in this section — using rectangles to approximate the area of strange shapes —

is part of every calculus course because integration rests on this foundation. But, in a sense,

this material doesn’t involve calculus at all. You could do everything in this section without

calculus, and if calculus had never been invented, you could still approximate area with the

methods described here.

Sigma Notation and Riemann Sums: Geek Stuﬀ

Now that you’re warmed up, it’s time to segue into summing some sophisticated sigma sums.

Sigma notation may look diﬃcult, but it’s really just a shorthand way of writing a long sum.

In a sigma sum problem, you can pull anything through the sigma symbol to the outside except

for a function of the index of summation (the i in the following example). Note that you can use

any letter you like for the index of summation, though i and k are customary.

Q. Evaluate 12 5i2 .

\2. Set the range of the sum.

A. The sum is 3,180.

Ask yourself what i must be to make the

ﬁrst term equal 503: That’s 5, of course.

And ask the same question about the last

term of 1503: i must be 15. Put the

5 and the 15 on the sigma symbol like

this:

\1. Create the argument of the sigma

function.

It’s often desirable to have i begin at 0

or 1. To turn the 5 into a 1, you

subtract 4. Then subtract 4 from the 15

as well. To compensate for this

subtraction, you add 4 to the i in the

argument:

The jump amount between terms in

a long sum will become the coeﬃ-

cient of the index of summation in a

sigma sum, so you know that 10i is

the basic term of your argument.

You want to cube each term, so that

Close Isn’t Good Enough: The Deﬁnite

Integral and Exact Area

Now, ﬁnally, the ﬁrst calculus in this chapter. Why settle for approximate areas when you can

use the deﬁnite integral to get exact areas?

The exact area under a curve between a and b is given by the deﬁnite integral, which is deﬁned

as follows:

b

n

f x dx lim

f xi

i

In plain English, this simply means that you can calculate the exact area under a curve between

two points by using the kind of formula you got in Step 10 of the previous example and then

taking the limit of that formula as n approaches inﬁnity. This gives you the exact area because

it sort of uses an inﬁnite number of inﬁnitely narrow rectangles. (Okay, so maybe that wasn’t

plain, but at least it was English.)

The function inside the deﬁnite integral is called the integrand.

Finding Area with the Trapezoid

Rule and Simpson’s Rule

To close this chapter, I give you two more ways to approximate an area. You can use these

methods when ﬁnding the exact area is impossible. (Just take my word for it that there are

functions that can’t be handled with ordinary integration to get an exact area.) With the

trapezoid rule, you draw trapezoids under the curve instead of rectangles. See Figure 10-1,

which shows the same function I used for the ﬁrst example in this chapter.

FIGURE 10-1:

(actually,

one’s a

triangle, but

exactly like a

trapezoid).

Note: You can’t actually see the trapezoids, because their tops mesh with the curve, y lnx. But

between each pair of points, such as A and B, there’s a straight trapezoid top in addition to the

curved piece of y lnx.

The Trapezoid Rule: You can approximate the exact area under a curve between a and b with a

sum of trapezoids given by the following formula. In general, the more trapezoids, the better

the estimate.

where n is the number of trapezoids, x0 equals a, and x1 through xn are the equally spaced

x coordinates of the right edges of trapezoids 1 through n.

Simpson’s Rule also uses trapezoid-like shapes, except that the top of each “trapezoid” —

instead of being a straight, slanting segment, as “shown” in Figure 10-1 — is a curve (actually

a small piece of a parabola) that very closely hugs the function. Because these little parabola

pieces are so close to the function, Simpson’s Rule gives the best area approximation of any of

the methods. If you’re wondering why you should learn the Trapezoid Rule when you can just

as easily use Simpson’s Rule and get a more accurate estimate, chalk it up to just one more

instance of the sadism of calculus teachers.

The area is 5.285.

\2. a. Draw the ﬁrst left rectangle by putting your pen at the left end of the ﬁrst base

(that’s at x 1 ) and going straight up till you hit the function.

Whoops. You’re already on the function at x 1, right? So, guess what? For this

particular problem, there is no ﬁrst rectangle — or you could say it’s a rectangle

with a height of zero and an area of zero.

b. Draw the “second” rectangle by putting your pen at x 1.5, going straight up till

you hit f

ln x; then go right till you’re directly above x 2; and then go down

to the x axis.

b. How is this approximation related to the area obtained with 10 right rectangles?

The only diﬀerence is that the sum for left rectangles has a 0 at the left end and the

sum for right rectangles has a 1.792 at the right end. The other 9 numbers in both

sums are the same. Look at the second line in the computation in Step 4 above. Note

that the sum of the 10 numbers inside the parentheses includes the ﬁrst 9 numbers in

the computation for right rectangles, which you see in Step 4 of the answer to the ﬁrst

example in this chapter. The only diﬀerence in the two sums is the left-most number

in the left-rectangle sum and the right-most number in the right-rectangle sum.

If you look at the ﬁgure in Step 2 of the example and at the ﬁgure in Step 3 of the solution

to 1(a), you’ll see why this works out this way. The ﬁrst rectangle in the example ﬁgure is

identical to the second rectangle in the solution 1(a) ﬁgure. The second rectangle in the

example ﬁgure is identical to the third rectangle in the solution 1(a) ﬁgure, and so on. The

only diﬀerence is that the solution 1(a) ﬁgure contains the left-most “rectangle” (the one

with a height of zero) and the example ﬁgure contains the tall, right-most rectangle.

A left-rectangle sum and a right-rectangle sum will always diﬀer by an amount equal

to the diﬀerence in area of the left-most left rectangle and the right-most right rect-

angle. (Memorize this sentence and recite it in class — with your right index ﬁnger

pointed upward for eﬀect. You’ll instantly become a babe [dude] magnet.)

Approximate the same area again with 10 midpoint rectangles. The approximate

area is 5.759.

\1. Sketch your curve and the 10 subintervals again.

\2. Compute the midpoints of the bases of all rectangles.

This should be a no-brainer: 1.25, 1.75, 2.25, . . . , 5.75.

Rank the approximations from the example and Problems 1 and 2 from best to worst and

defend your ranking. The midpoint rectangles give the best estimate because each rectangle

goes above the curve (in this sense, it’s too big) and also leaves an uncounted gap below the

curve (in this sense, it’s too small). These two errors cancel each other out to some extent.

By the way, the exact area is about 5.751. The approximate area with 10 midpoint rectangles,

5.759, is only about 0.14% oﬀ.

It’s harder to rank the left versus the right rectangle estimates. Kudos if you noticed that

because of the shape of f

x

ln x, right rectangles will give a slightly better estimate

(technically, it’s because ln x is concave down and increasing). It turns out that the right-

rectangle approximation is oﬀ by 7.48%, and the left-rectangle estimate is oﬀ by 8.10%. If

you missed this question, don’t sweat it. It’s basically an extra-credit type question.

Use 8 left, right, and midpoint rectangles to approximate the area under sinx from 0 to .

The approximations are, respectively, 1.974, 1.974, and 2.013.

The exact area under sinx from 0 to has the wonderfully simple answer of 2. The error of

the midpoint rectangle estimate is 0.65%, and the other two have an error of 1.3%. The left

wave.

n this chapter, you really get into integration in full swing. First you look at the annoying

area function, then the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and then two beginner integra-

tion methods.

The Absolutely Atrocious and

Annoying Area Function

The area function is both more diﬃcult and less useful than the material that follows it. With

any luck, your calc teacher will skip it or just give you a cursory introduction to it. Once you

ﬁnish this section and get to the next section on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, you’ll

have no more use for the area function. It’s taught because it’s the foundation for the all-

important Fundamental Theorem.

The area function is an odd duck and doesn’t look like any function you’ve ever seen before:

x

Af

x

f t dt

s

CHAPTER 11 Integration: Reverse Diﬀerentiation

213





The input of the function (its argument) is the x on top of the integral symbol. Note that f t

is not the argument. The output, Af x , tells you how much area is swept out under the curve,

f t , as you sweep along the horizontal axis from left to right from some starting point, s, up to

the x value. (Note that the horizontal axis is called the t axis in these problems.) For example,

x

consider the simple horizontal line g t

10 and the area function based on it, Ag

x

10dt.

3

This area function tells you how much area is under the horizontal line (which is at a height of

\10) between vertical lines at 3 and at the x value. When x 4, the area is 10 because you have a

rectangle with a base of 1 (from 3 to 4) and a height of 10. When x 5, the rectangle’s base is

now 2, so it’s area and the output of the function is 20; when x 6, the output is 30, and so on.

(For an excellent and thorough explanation of the area function and how it relates to the Fun-

damental Theorem, check out Calculus For Dummies, 2nd Edition.) The best way to get a handle

on this weird function is to see it in action, so here goes.

Don’t forget that when using an area function (or a deﬁnite integral — stay tuned), area below

the horizontal axis counts as negative area.

Q. Consider f t , shown in the following

f t dt, approximate Af 4 ,

2

Af 5 , Af 2 , and Af 0 . Also, is Af

increasing or decreasing between x

and x 6? Between x 8 and x 9?

Af 0 is another area roughly in the

shape of a trapezoid. Its height is 2

and its bases are 2 and 3, so its area is

about 5. But because you go backward

from 2 to zero, Af 0 equals about –5.

5

Between x = 5 and x = 6, Af is

increasing. Be careful here: f t is

decreasing between 5 and 6, but as

you go from 5 to 6, Af sweeps out

more and more area so it’s increasing.

Between x = 8 and x = 9, while f

t

is increasing Af is decreasing. Area

below the t axis counts as negative

area, so in moving from 8 to 9, Af

sweeps out more and more negative

area, and it thus grows more and

more negative. Af is therefore

decreasing.

Sound the Trumpets: The Fundamental

Theorem of Calculus

The absolutely incredibly fantastic Fundamental Theorem of Calculus — some say one of or

perhaps the greatest theorem in the history of mathematics — gives you a neat shortcut for

ﬁnding area so you don’t have to deal with the annoying area function or that rectangle mumbo

jumbo from Chapter 10. The basic idea is that you use the antiderivative of a function to ﬁnd the

area under it.

Let me jog your memory on antiderivatives: Because 3x2 is the derivative of x3, x3 is an antide-

rivative of 3x2. But so is x3 5 because its derivative is also 3x2. So anything of the form x 3

C

(where C is a constant) is an antiderivative of 3x2. (Technically, you say that x3 C is the family

of antiderivatives of 3x2, not that it is the antiderivative of 3x2; but you can say that x3 C is

the indeﬁnite integral of 3x2.)

The Fundamental Theorem comes in two versions: the easy, more useful version and the diﬃ-

cult, less useful version. You learn the diﬃcult, less useful version for basically the same reason

you studied geometry proofs in high school, namely, “just because.”

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (the diﬃcult, less useful version): Given an area function

x

Af that sweeps out area under f t , Af

x

f t dt, the rate at which area is being swept out is

s

equal to the height of the original function. So, because the rate is the derivative, the derivative

d

x

of the area function equals the original function:

Af

x

f x . Because Af

you can also write the previous equation as follows:

Q. a. For the area function

The argument of an area function is

Finding Antiderivatives: The Guess-

of them are simply the basic derivative rules you know written in reverse.) When you face a

problem that’s similar to one of these — like ﬁnding the antiderivative of sin 5x or

can use the guess-and-check method: Just guess your answer and check it by diﬀerentiating;

then if it’s wrong, tweak it till it works.

When you check that guess by taking

The Substitution Method:

Pulling the Switcheroo

The group of guess-and-check problems in the previous section involves integrands that diﬀer

from the standard integrand of a memorized antiderivative rule by a numerical amount. The

next set of problems involves integrands where the extra thing they contain includes a variable

expression. For these problems, you can still use the guess-and-check method, but the tradi-

tional way of doing such problems is with the substitution method.

Solutions to Reverse Diﬀerentiation Problems

Where (from x 0 to x 8) does Ag equal 0? At about x 2 or 2 and about x 6.

Ag equals zero twice between x 0 and x 8. First, somewhere between x 2 and x 2 1

2

where the negative area beginning at x 1 cancels out the positive area between x

1

and

2

x

\1. The second zero of Ag is somewhere between x 51 2 and x 6. After the ﬁrst zero at

about x 21 4, negative area is added between 21 4 and 4. The positive area from 4 to, say, 5 3

roughly cancels that out, so Ag returns to zero at about x 53 4.

4

2

Where (from x 0 to x 8) does Ag reach

a. its maximum value? Ag reaches its max at about x 8. After the zero at about x

5

, Ag

4

3

grows by roughly 3 square units by the time x gets to 8.

1

4

b. its minimum value? The minimum value of Ag is at x 4 where it equals something like

11 2. Note that this minimum occurs at the point where all the negative area has been

added (minimums often occur at points like that) and that when you move to the right

past x 4, the area crosses above the t axis and the area begins to increase.

3

In what intervals between 0 and 8 is Ag

a. increasing? Ag is increasing from 0 to 1 and from 4 to 8.

b. decreasing? Ag is decreasing from 1 to 4.

Approximate Ag 1 , Ag 3 , and Ag 5 .

4

Ag 1 is a bit bigger than the right triangle with base from x

1

to x 1 on the t axis and

2

vertex maybe at 1 2, 4 , which has an area of 1. So the area in question is slightly more than 1.

There’s a zero at about 21 4. Between there and x 3 the area is very roughly –1, so Ag

3 is

about –1.

In Problem 2b, you estimate Ag 4 to be about 11 2. Between 4 and 5, there’s sort of a trian-

gular shape with a rough area of 1 2. Thus Ag equals about 1

or roughly –1.

You’ll get a math ticket if you put an equal sign in front of the last line because it is not equal

to the line before it. When you don’t change the limits of integration, you get this mixed-up

integral with an integrand in terms of u, but with limits of integration in terms of x (s in this

problem). This may be one reason why the preferred book method includes switching the

limits of integration — it’s mathematically cleaner.

Integration Rules for

Calculus Connoisseurs

I

n this chapter, you work on some complex and challenging integration techniques. The

methods may seem quite diﬃcult at ﬁrst, but, like with anything, they’re not that bad at all

after some practice.

Integration by Parts: Here’s How u du It

Integration by parts is the counterpart of the product rule for diﬀerentiation (see Chapter 6),

because the integrand in question is the product of two functions (usually). Here’s the method

in a nutshell. You split up the two functions in the integrand, diﬀerentiate one, integrate the

other, and then apply the integration-by-parts formula. This process converts the original

integrand — which you can’t integrate — into an integrand you can integrate. Clear as mud,

right? You’ll catch on to the technique real quick if you use the following LIATE acronym and

the box method in the example. First, here’s the formula:

For integration by parts, here’s what u du: u dv uv v du.

Don’t try to understand that until you work through an example problem. Your ﬁrst challenge

in an integration-by-parts problem is to decide what function in your original integrand will

play the role of the u in the formula. Here’s how you do it.

CHAPTER 12 Integration Rules for Calculus Connoisseurs

229





To select your u function, just go down the following list; the ﬁrst function type from this list

that’s in your integrand is your u. To remember the list, just remember the acronym LIATE:

»

Logarithmic (like lnx)

»

»

»

»

Inverse trigonometric (like arcsinx)

Algebraic (like 4x3 10)

Trigonometric (like sinx)

Exponential (like 5x)

I wish I could take credit for this LIATE method, but credit goes to Herbert Kasube (see his

article in American Mathematical Monthly 90, 1983). I can, however, take credit for the follow-

ing brilliant mnemonic device to help you remember the acronym: Lilliputians In Africa Tackle

Elephants.

\1. Pick your u function.

The integrand contains a logarith-

list), so ln x is your u. Everything

else in the integrand — namely

x2 dx — is automatically your dv.

Transﬁguring Trigonometric Integrals

Don’t you just love trig? I’ll bet you didn’t realize that studying calculus was going to give you

the opportunity to do so much more trig. Remember this next Thanksgiving when everyone

around the dinner table is invited to mention something that they’re thankful for.

This section lets you practice integrating expressions containing trigonometric functions. The

basic idea is to ﬁddle with the integrand until you’re able to ﬁnish with a u-substitution (see

Chapter 11). In the next section, you use some fancy trigonometric substitutions to solve inte-

grals that don’t contain trig functions.

The Pythagorean Identity tells

you that sin2 x cos2 x 1 for any

this identity by sin2 x, by the way,

you get another form of the iden-

tity: 1 cot2 x csc2 x. If you divide

by cos2 x, you get tan2 x

Trigonometric Substitution:

It’s Your Lucky Day!

In this section, you tackle integrals containing radicals of the following three forms: u2 a2 ,

u2 a2 , and a2 u2 , as well as powers of those roots. To solve these problems, you use a

SohCahToa right triangle, the Pythagorean Theorem, and some fancy trigonometric substitu-

tions. I’m sure you’ll have no trouble with this technique — it’s even easier than string theory.

Because Step 4 only gave you one

term, take a diﬀerent tack. If you mul-

tiply (FOIL) everything out in the Step

3 equation, the right side of the equa-

tion will contain a constant term and

terms in x, x 2, x 3, x 4, x 5, and x 6. This

equation is an identity, so the coeﬃ-

cient of, say, the x 5 term on the right

has to equal the coeﬃcient of the x 5

term on the left (which is 0 in this

problem). So set the coeﬃcient of each

term on the right equal to the coeﬃ-

cient of its corresponding term on the

left. Here’s your ﬁnal result:

their denominator and those with

dratic — in their denominator. Also

note there is a fraction for each

You can quickly obtain the values of all

seven unknowns from these seven

equations, and thus you could have

skipped Step 4. But plugging in roots

is so easy, and the values you get may

help you ﬁnish the problem faster, so

it’s always a good thing to do.

\4. Plug the roots of the linear factors

into x (0 is the only root).

Plugging 0 into x eliminates every

to go.

And there’s a third way to solve for

the unknowns. You can obtain a

system of equations like the one in

this step by plugging non-root values

into x in the equation from Step 3.

(You should use small numbers that

are easy to calculate with.) After doing

several partial fraction problems,

you’ll get a feel for what combination

of the three techniques works best for

each problem.

Who Needs Freud?

Using the Integral to

Solve Your Problems

N

ow that you’re an expert at integrating, it’s time to put that awesome power to use to

solve some . . . ahem . . . real-world problems. All right, I admit it — the problems you

see in this chapter won’t seem to bear much connection to reality. But, in fact, inte-

gration is a powerful and practical mathematical tool. Engineers, scientists, and economists,

among others, do important, practical work with integration that they couldn’t do without it.

Finding a Function’s Average Value

With diﬀerentiation, you can determine the maximum and minimum heights of a function,

its steepest points, its inﬂection points, its concavity, and so on. But there’s a simple question

about a function that diﬀerentiation cannot answer: What’s the function’s average height? To

answer that, you need integration.

Finding the Area between Curves

In elementary school and high school geometry, you learned area formulas for all sorts of

shapes like rectangles, circles, triangles, parallelograms, kites, and so on. Big deal. With inte-

gration, you can determine things like the area between f x

Volumes of Weird Solids: No, You’re

Never Going to Need This

Integration works by cutting something up into an inﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimal pieces and

then adding the pieces up to compute the total. In this way, integration is able to determine

the volume of bizarre shapes that don’t have volume formulas: It cuts the shapes up into thin

pieces that have ordinary shapes that can be calculated with ordinary geometry formulas. This

section shows you three diﬀerent methods:

»

The meat slicer method: This works just like a deli meat slicer — you cut a shape into ﬂat,

thin slices. You then add up the volume of the slices. This method is used for odd, some-

times asymmetrical shapes.

»

»

The disk/washer method: With this method, you cut up the given shape into thin, ﬂat disks

or washers. This method is used for shapes with circular cross-sections.

The cylindrical shell method: Here, you cut your volume up into thin nested shells. Each

one ﬁts snugly inside the next widest one, like telescoping tubes or nested Russian dolls.

This method is also used for shapes with circular cross-sections.

heights grow linearly from zero at the origin to 1 when x 1.

\1. Always try to sketch the ﬁgure ﬁrst (of course, I’ve done it for you here).

\2. Indicate on your sketch a representative thin slice of the volume in question.

This slice should always be perpendicular to the axis or direction along which

you are integrating. In other words, if your integrand contains, say, a dx, your

slice should be perpendicular to the x axis. Also, the slice should not be at either

end of the three-dimensional ﬁgure or at any other special place. Rather, it

should be at some arbitrary, nondescript location within the shape.

\3. Express the volume of this slice.

It’s easy to show — trust me — that the height of each triangle is the same as its

x coordinate. Its base goes from

First, here’s how the vase is “created.” The light-gray shaded area shown in the

ﬁgure lies between x and 0.75 x 1 from x 0 to x 9. The three-dimensional vase

shape is generated by revolving the shaded area about the x axis.

\1. Sketch the 3-D shape (already done for you).

\2. Indicate a representative slice (see the dark-gray shaded area in the ﬁgure).

\3. Express the volume of the representative slice.

A representative slice in a washer problem looks like — can you guess? — a

washer. See the following ﬁgure.

The large circle has an area of R2, and the hole an area of r 2. So a washer’s

\4. Add up the washers by integrating from 0 to 9.

But wait; did you notice the slight snag in this problem? The “washers” from

x

0 to x 1 have no holes, so there’s no little-r circle to subtract from the big-R

circle. A washer without a hole is called a disk, but you treat it the same as a

washer except you don’t subtract a hole.

Again, this is the same vase as in the disk/washer example, but this time it’s repre-

sented by diﬀerent functions. In a random act of kindness, I ﬁgured the new functions

for you.

\1. Express the volume of your representative shell.

To ﬁgure the volume of a representative shell, imagine taking the label oﬀ a can

of soup — when you lay it ﬂat, it’s a rectangle, right? The area is thus

base height, and the base of the rectangle comes from the circumference of the

can. So the area is 2 rh. (r equals x and h depends on the given functions.) The

thickness of the shell is dx, so its volume is 2 rh dx.

Wait! Another snag — a bit similar to the snag in the previous example. The

3 2

smaller shells, with right edges at x 0 up to x

, have heights that measure

2

3 2

from f x up to g x . But the larger shells, with right edges at x

to x 3,

have heights that measure from f x up to 9. So you have to integrate the two

batches of shells separately.

up this way because it simpliﬁes it. You can

draw the y axis the regular way if you like,

Arc Length and Surfaces of Revolution

You can use integration to determine the length of a curve by sort of cutting up the curve into

an inﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimal segments, each of which is basically the hypotenuse of a

tiny right triangle. Then your pedestrian Pythagorean Theorem does the rest. The same basic

idea applies to surfaces of revolution. Here are two handy formulas for solving these problems:

Integrals

he main topic of this chapter is really amazing when you stop and think about it: cal-

culating the area (or volume) of shapes that are inﬁnitely long. The word inﬁnity comes

up in mathematics so often that perhaps we become jaded about the concept and forget

how truly incredible it is. It’s about 93 million miles from the earth to the sun. That distance

is so great that it’s nearly impossible to wrap our minds around it, but it’s nothing compared

to the distance to Alpha Centauri A (the nearest star), which is 4.24 light-years away — about

268,000 times as far as the distance to the sun. Our Milky Way Galaxy is about 100,000 light-

years across, and it’s about 4½ million light-years to our nearest spiral galaxy neighbor, the

Andromeda Galaxy. Go out about 10,000 times that far and you reach the “edge” of the observ-

able universe at about 46 or 47 billion light-years away. That’s deﬁnitely quite a ways out

there, but it’s nothing compared to inﬁnity.

The shapes you deal with in this chapter are not just bigger than the entire universe; they’re so

big that they make the universe seem like a speck of dust by comparison. And, yet, using the

powerful tools of calculus (including L’Hôpital’s Rule), we’re able to compute the area of these

gargantuan shapes. And some of them turn out to have nice, manageable areas like, say, 10

square inches! It’s time to get started.

Getting Your Hopes Up with L’Hôpital’s Rule

This powerful little rule enables you to easily compute limits that are either diﬃcult or impos-

sible without it.

L’Hôpital’s Rule: When plugging the arrow-number into a limit expression gives you 0 0

or

, you replace the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives and

do the limit problem again — repeating this process if necessary — until you arrive at a limit

you can solve.

If you’re wondering why this limit rule is in the middle of this chapter about integration, it’s

because you need L’Hôpital’s Rule for the next section and the next chapter.

Disciplining Those Improper Integrals

In this section, you bring some discipline to integrals that misbehave by going up, down, left,

or right to inﬁnity. You handle inﬁnity, as usual, with limits. The ﬁrst example’s an integral

that goes up to inﬁnity.

Inﬁnite Series: Welcome

to the Outer Limits

L

ike Chapter 14, this chapter deals with the inﬁnite. In Chapter 15, you investigate lists of

numbers that never end. And, quite remarkably, you discover that some of these inﬁnitely

long lists of numbers (that wouldn’t even ﬁt in the entire universe if written out com-

pletely) can actually be added up — summing to a nice, ordinary ﬁnite number! These lists of

numbers that can be added up are called convergent series. The lists of numbers you can’t total

up are called divergent series. Your task in this chapter is to decide which are which.

The Nifty nth Term Test

One of the easiest tests you can use to help you decide whether a series converges or diverges

is the nth term test. This test sort of looks at what’s happening way out toward the “end” of

an inﬁnite list of numbers. (Of course, there isn’t actually an end of an inﬁnite list.) You might

say that the nth term test looks at what’s happening to the numbers in the list the farther and

farther you go out along the list. Before deﬁning the test formally, I go over a couple terms.

A sequence is a ﬁnite or inﬁnite list of numbers (this chapter deals only with inﬁnite sequences).

When you add up the terms of a sequence, the sequence becomes a series. For example,

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,... is a sequence, and

1 2

4

8 16 32 64

is the related series.

an diverges. In English, this says that if a series’ under-

n

It does not follow that if a series’ underlying sequence converges to zero, then the series will

deﬁnitely converge. It may converge, but there’s no guarantee.

Q

Does

1

If your teacher doesn’t like that

approach, you can do the following:

n

1

A. It diverges.

Plugging into the limit produces

You can answer this question with

common sense if your calc teacher

1

, which is1 , and that

0

equals 1 — you’re done. (Note that

is not one of the forms that gives

you a L’Hôpital’s Rule problem —

allows such a thing. As n gets larger

1

1

0

and larger, 1

increases and gets

n

closer and closer to one. And when you

take any root of a number like 0.9, the

root is larger than the original

number — and the higher the root

index, the larger the answer is. So

1

see Chapter 14.) Because lim 1

diverges by the

real stickler for rigor, he or she

might not like this approach either

because, technically, you’re not

supposed to plug into n even

though it works just ﬁne. Oh,

well. . . . )

has to get larger as n increases,

Apples and Oranges . . . and Guavas:

Three Comparison Tests

With the three comparison tests, you compare the series in question to a benchmark series. If

the benchmark converges, so does the given series; if the benchmark diverges, the given series

does as well.

The direct comparison test: Given that 0 an bn for all n, if

an, and if an diverges, so does bn .

bn converges, so does

This could be called the well, duh test. All it says is that a series with terms equal to or

greater than the terms of a divergent series must also diverge, and that a series with terms

equal to or less than the terms of a convergent series must also converge.

Ratiocinating the Two “R” Tests

Here you practice the ratio test and the root test. With both tests, a result less than 1 means that

the series in question converges; a result greater than 1 means that the series diverges; and a

result of 1 tells you nothing.

»

The ratio test: Given a series un, consider the limit of the ratio of a term to the previ-

un

ous term, lim

1 . If this limit is less than 1, the series converges. If it’s greater than 1 (this

u

n

n

includes ), the series diverges. And if it equals 1, the ratio test tells you nothing.

»

The root test: Note its similarity to the ratio test. Given a series un, consider the limit

of the nth root of the nth term, lim u . If this limit is less than 1, the series converges. If

n

n

n

it’s greater than one (including ), the series diverges. And if it equals 1, the root test says

nothing.

The ratio test is a good test to try if the series involves factorials like n! or where n is in the

power, like 2n. The root test also works well when the series contains nth powers. If you’re not

sure which test to try ﬁrst, start with the ratio test — it’s often the easier one to use.

He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not:

Alternating Series

n

n

\1.

Alternating series look just like any other series except that they contain an extra

1

or

1

This extra term causes the terms of the series to alternate between positive and negative.

An alternating series converges if two conditions are met:

\1. Its nth term converges to zero.

\2. Its terms are non-increasing.

In other words, each term is either smaller than or the same as its predecessor (ignoring

the minus sign).

For the problems in this section, determine whether the series converges or diverges. If it

converges, determine whether the convergence is absolute or conditional.

If you take a convergent alternating series and make all the terms positive and it still con-

verges, then the alternating series is said to converge absolutely. If, on the other hand, the series

of positive terms diverges, then the alternating series converges conditionally.

Thus, this is not a geometric series, and therefore the geometric series rule does not apply.

And you can’t actually ﬁnish this problem with the ideas presented in this section — sorry

about that. But can you guess whether this series converges or not (assuming the pattern

4, 8, 12, 16, 20 continues)? To ﬁnish the problem, you need to use the limit comparison test

covered in the “Apples and Oranges . . . and Guavas” section. You can prove that this series

diverges by comparing it to the divergent harmonic series.

This is a bit tricky. You ﬁrst have to notice — ignoring the ﬁrst term (1/2 ) — that the rest of

the denominators make a simple pattern of multiples of four: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. . . . This allows

1

you to rewrite the series — again, ignoring the ﬁrst term — as

Ten Things about

Limits, Continuit y,

and Inﬁnite Series

I

n this very short chapter, I give you two great mnemonics for memorizing a great deal about

limits, continuity, derivatives, and inﬁnite series. If I do say so myself, you’re getting a lot

of bang for your buck here.

The 33333 Mnemonic

This mnemonic is a memory aid for limits, continuity, and derivatives. First, note that I’ve put

the word “limil” under the ﬁve threes. That’s “limit” with the t changed to an l. Also note the

nice parallel between “limil” and the second mnemonic in this chapter, the 13231 mnemonic —

in both cases, you have two pairs surrounding a single letter or number in the center.

First 3 over the “l”: 3 parts to the

deﬁnition of a limit

You can ﬁnd the formal deﬁnition of a limit in Chapter 3. This mnemonic helps you remember

that it has three parts. And — take my word for it — just that is usually enough to help you

remember what the three parts are. Try it.

Fifth 3 over the “l”: 3 cases where

a limit fails to exist

The three cases are

»

»

»

At a vertical asymptote. This is an inﬁnite discontinuity.

At a jump discontinuity.

With the limit at inﬁnity or negative inﬁnity of an oscillating function like lim cosx where the

,

x

function keeps oscillating up and down forever, never homing in on a single y value.

Second 3 over the “i”: 3 parts to

the deﬁnition of continuity

First notice the oh-so-clever fact that the letter i can’t be drawn without taking your pen oﬀ

the paper and, thus, that it’s not continuous. This will help you remember that the second and

fourth 3s concern continuity.

The three-part, formal deﬁnition of continuity is in Chapter 3. The mnemonic will help you

remember that it has three parts. And — just like with the deﬁnition of a limit — that’s enough

to help you remember what the three parts are.

Fourth 3 over the “i”: 3 cases where

continuity fails to exist

The three cases are

»

A removable discontinuity — the highfalutin calculus term for a hole.

An inﬁnite discontinuity.

A jump discontinuity.

312

PART 5 The Part of Tens





Third 3 over the “m”: 3 cases where

a derivative fails to exist

Note that m often stands for slope, right? And the slope is the same thing as the derivative. The

three cases where it fails to exist are

»

»

At any type of discontinuity.

At a sharp point along a function (there are two types, corners and cusps). These sharp

points only occur in weird functions you won’t see very often.

»

At a vertical tangent. (A vertical line has an undeﬁned slope and thus an undeﬁned

derivative.)

The 13231 Mnemonic

This mnemonic helps you remember the ten tests for the convergence or divergence of an inﬁ-

nite series covered in Chapter 15. 1 10 total tests.

3

2 3 1

First 1: The nth term test of divergence

For any series, if the nth term doesn’t converge to zero, the series diverges.

Second 1: The nth term test of convergence

for alternating series

The real name of this test is the alternating series test. But I’m referring to it as the nth term test

of convergence because that’s a pretty good way to think about it for three reasons: because it

has a lot in common with the nth term test of divergence, because these two tests make nice

bookends for the other eight tests, and, last but not least, because it’s my book.

An alternating series will converge if 1) its nth term converges to 0, and 2) each term is less

than or equal to the preceding term (ignoring the negative signs).

Note the following nice parallel between the two nth term tests: With the nth term test of diver-

gence, if the nth term fails to converge to zero, then the series must fail to converge, but it is not

true that if the nth term does converge to zero, then the series must converge. With the alter-

nating series nth term test, it’s the other way around (sort of). If the test succeeds, then the

series must converge, but it is not true that if the test fails, then the series must fail to converge.

First 3: The three tests with names

This “3” helps you remember the three types of series that have names: geometric series (which

converge if r 1), p-series (which converge if p 1), and telescoping series.

CHAPTER 16 Ten Things about Limits, Continuity, and Inﬁnite Series

313





Second 3: The three comparison tests

The direct comparison test, the limit comparison test, and the integral comparison test all work

the same way. You compare a given series to a known benchmark series. If the benchmark con-

verges, so does the given series, and ditto for divergence.

The 2 in the middle: The two R tests

The ratio test and the root test make a coherent pair because for both tests, if the limit is less

than 1, the series converges; if the limit is greater than 1, the series diverges; and if the limit

equals 1, the test tells you nothing.

Ten Things You Better

Remember about

Diﬀerentiation

I

n this chapter, I give you ten important things you should know about diﬀerentiation. Refer

to these pages often. When you get these ten things down cold, you’ll have taken a not-

insigniﬁcant step toward becoming a diﬀerentiation expert.

The First Derivative Is a Rate

A ﬁrst derivative tells you how much y changes per unit change in x along a line tangent to a

function. For example, if y is in miles and x is in hours, and if at some point along the function

CHAPTER 17 Ten Things You Better Remember about Diﬀerentiation

315





(on the tangent line), y goes up 3 when x goes over 1, you’ve got 3 miles per 1 hour, or 3 mph.

That’s the rate and that’s the derivative.

The First Derivative Is a Slope

In the previous example, when y goes up 3 (the rise) as x goes over 1 (the run) on a line tangent

to the function, the slope (rise/run) at that point of the function would be 3 over 1, or 3 of course.

That’s the slope and that’s the derivative.

Extrema, Sign Changes, and the First Derivative

When the sign of the ﬁrst derivative changes from positive to negative or vice versa, that means

that you went up and then down (and thus passed over the top of a hill, a local max), or you went

down and then up (and thus passed through the bottom of a valley, a local min). In both of these

cases (called local extrema), when you hit the very max or min, the ﬁrst derivative will usually

equal zero, though it may be undeﬁned (if the local extremum is at a cusp or a corner). Also, note

that if the ﬁrst derivative equals zero, you may have a horizontal inﬂection point rather than a

local extremum.

The Second Derivative and Concavity

A positive second derivative tells you that a function is concave up (like a spoon holding water

or like a smile). A negative second derivative means concave down (like a spoon spilling water

or like a frown).

Inﬂection Points and Sign Changes

in the Second Derivative

Note the nice parallels between second derivative sign changes and ﬁrst derivative sign changes

described in the section above.

When the sign of the second derivative changes from positive to negative or vice versa, that

means that the concavity of the function changed from up to down or down to up. In either

case, you’re likely at an inﬂection point (though you could be at a cusp or a corner). At an inﬂec-

tion point, the second derivative will usually equal zero, though it may be undeﬁned if there’s

a vertical tangent at the inﬂection point. Also, if the second derivative equals zero, that does not

guarantee that you’re at an inﬂection point. The second derivative can equal zero at a point

where the function is concave up or down (like, for example, at 0, 0 on the curve y x4 where

the second derivative equals zero but the curve is concave up).

316

PART 5 The Part of Tens





The Product Rule

The derivative of a product of two functions equals the derivative of the ﬁrst times the second

d

dx

plus the ﬁrst times the derivative of the second. In symbols,

uv u v uv .

The Quotient Rule

The derivative of a quotient of two functions equals the derivative of the top times the bot-

tom minus the top times the derivative of the bottom, all over the bottom squared. In symbols,

d

dx

u

v

u v uv

v2

.

Note that the numerator of the quotient rule is identical to the product rule except for the sub-

traction. For both rules, you begin by taking the derivative of the ﬁrst thing you read: the left

function in a product and the top function in a quotient.

Linear Approximation

Here’s the fancy calculus formula for a linear approximation: l x

f x1

f

x1

x

x1

.

If trying to memorize this leaves you feeling frustrated, ﬂabbergasted, feebleminded,

ﬂummoxed, or ﬁt to be tied, consider this: It’s just an equation of a line, and its meaning is

identical to the point-slope form for the equation of a line you learned in algebra I (tweaked a

bit): y y1 m x x1

.

“PSST,” Here’s a Good Way to Remember

the Derivatives of Trig Functions

Say you’re taking a test and you can’t remember the derivative of cosecant. You lean to the

guy/gal next to you and whisper: “PSST, what’s the derivative of cosecant?” (I hope it goes

without saying that I’m not recommending this.) Now, take the last three letters in PSST and

write down the trig functions that begin with those letters: secant, secant, tangent. Below these

write their co-functions, cosecant, cosecant, cotangent, and add a negative sign in front of the

csc in the middle. Then add arrows. The arrows point to the derivatives. For example, the arrow

after secant points to its derivative, sec tan; and the arrow next to tangent points backward

to its derivative, sec2. This mnemonic may seem a bit convoluted, but it works. Here you go:

sec

Calculus Workbook For Dummies





About the Author

A

graduate of Brown University and the University of Wisconsin Law School, Mark

Ryan has been teaching math since 1989. He runs the Math Center in Winnetka, Illinois

([www.themathcenter.com](http://www.themathcenter.com)), where he teaches junior high and high school math courses,

including an introduction to calculus. In high school, he twice scored a perfect 800 on the math

portion of the SAT, and he not only knows mathematics, he has a gift for explaining it in plain

English. He practiced law for four years before deciding he should do something he enjoys and

use his natural talent for mathematics. Ryan is a member of the Authors Guild and the National

Council of Teachers of Mathematics.

Calculus Workbook For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is Ryan’s 11th math book. Everyday Math for Everyday

Life was published in 2002 and Calculus For Dummies (Wiley) in 2003; eight more books

published by Wiley followed. His books have sold over half a million copies.

Ryan lives in Evanston, Illinois. For fun, he hikes, skies, plays platform tennis, travels, plays on

a pub trivia team, and roots for the Chicago Blackhawks.

Author’s Acknowledgments

For the First Edition (2005):

My agent Sheree Bykofsky of Sheree Bykofsky Associates, Inc., has represented me now on

three successful books. Her ability to make connections in the publishing world and to close

deals — and to see the forest when I might be looking at the trees — has made her invaluable.

Many thanks to my bright, professional, and computer-savvy assistants, Benjamin Mumford,

Randy Claussen, and Caroline DeVane. Josh Dillon did a meticulous review of the mathemat-

ics in the book. He knows calculus and how to communicate it clearly. And a special thanks to

the multi-talented Amanda Wasielewski, who did everything from typing the book’s techni-

cal equations to creating diagrams to keeping the project organized to checking the calculus

content.

Gene Schwartz, President of Consortium House, publishing consultants, and an expert in all

aspects of publishing, gave me valuable advice for my contract negotiations. My friend, Beverly

Wright, psychoacoustician and writer extraordinaire, was also a big help with the contract

negotiations. She gave me astute and much needed advice and was generous with her time. I’m

grateful to my consultant, Josh Lowitz, Adjunct Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship at the

University of Chicago School of Business. He advised me on every phase of the book’s produc-

tion. His insights into my writing career and other aspects of my business, and his accessibility,

might make you think I was his only client instead of one of a couple dozen.

This book is a testament to the high standards of everyone at Wiley. Special thanks to Joyce

Pepple, Acquisitions Director, who handled our contract negotiations with intelligence, honesty,

and fairness, and to Acquisitions Editor Kathy Cox, who deftly combined praise with a touch

of gentle prodding to keep me on schedule. Technical Editor Dale Johnson did an excellent and

thorough job spotting and correcting the errors that appeared in the book’s ﬁrst draft — some

of which would be very hard or impossible to ﬁnd without an expert’s knowledge of calculus.





The layout and graphics team did a fantastic job with the book’s thousands of complex equa-

tions and mathematical ﬁgures.

Finally, the book would not be what it is without the contributions of Project Editor Laura

Peterson-Nussbaum. She’s an intelligent and skilled editor with a great sense of language

and balance. And she has the ability to tactfully suggest creative changes— most of which I

adopted — without interfering with my idiosyncratic style. It was a pleasure to work with her.

For the Second Edition (2015) and Third Edition (2018):

I’ve worked for many years with acquisitions editor Lindsay Sandman Lefevere. She’s intel-

ligent, professional, down-to-earth, and has a great sense of humor. And she has a special

way of dealing with my oh-so-minor personality foibles with patience, skill, and ﬁnesse. It’s

always a pleasure to work with her. I’ve done four books with project editor Tim Gallan. He’s

a very talented and experienced editor who has a deft touch with the many aspects of taking

a book from start to ﬁnish. He understands the forest, the trees, when to edit, and when not

to edit. Editor Danielle Voirol did a great job with the painstaking task of creating the liter-

ally thousands of mathematical equations and symbols in the book. Christine Pingleton did a

thorough and meticulous job with the copy editing for the book. Finally, Dr. Jason J. Molitierno,

technical reviewer, did an excellent job reviewing all the calculus content in the book. He’s

a calculus expert with a great eye for spotting errors, and he made valuable suggestions for

improving the mathematics exposition. This book is a testament to the high standards of

everyone at Wiley.
